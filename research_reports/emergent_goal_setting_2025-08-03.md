## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive framework for emergent, intrinsically motivated goal setting in embodied AI agents operating within voxel worlds.

## Introduction

Traditional game AI and embodied agents typically operate under externally imposed objectives - collect resources, defeat enemies, or reach specific locations. However, truly autonomous agents should be capable of setting their own goals based on intrinsic motivations, leading to more diverse, creative, and human-like behaviors.

### The Challenge

Creating emergent goal-setting systems faces several key challenges:
- **Open-endedness**: Goals must remain diverse and avoid convergence to trivial behaviors
- **Meaningful progression**: Generated goals should lead to skill development and increased capabilities
- **Contextual relevance**: Goals should make sense given the agent's current state and environment
- **Computational efficiency**: Goal generation must be lightweight enough for real-time operation

## Theoretical Foundations

### Intrinsic Motivation Theory

Drawing from developmental psychology and neuroscience, we identify four primary drivers of intrinsic motivation:

1. **Curiosity**: The drive to explore novel states and reduce uncertainty
2. **Competence**: The desire to master skills and increase capabilities
3. **Autonomy**: The need for self-direction and choice
4. **Purpose**: The search for meaningful patterns and higher-order objectives

### Computational Models of Motivation

#### Information-Theoretic Curiosity
Based on Schmidhuber's compression progress theory:
- Agents seek experiences that improve their world model
- Reward is proportional to compression improvement
- Balances exploration of unknown with exploitation of learnable patterns

#### Empowerment Maximization
From Klyubin et al.'s work on information-theoretic intrinsic motivation:
- Agents maximize their potential influence over future states
- Leads to behaviors that increase option availability
- Naturally produces tool use and environmental manipulation

#### Learning Progress
Inspired by Oudeyer's developmental robotics:
- Focus on areas with maximum learning potential
- Avoid both trivial and impossible challenges
- Adaptive curriculum emerges from agent's own progress

## Mathematical Framework

### Core Formulation

Let's define the goal generation function G:

```
G: S × H × C → g
```

Where:
- S: Current world state
- H: Agent's history and memory
- C: Agent's capabilities/skills
- g: Generated goal

### Intrinsic Reward Components

The total intrinsic reward R_i for a potential goal g:

```
R_i(g) = α·N(g) + β·L(g) + γ·E(g) + δ·M(g)
```

Where:
- N(g): Novelty score
- L(g): Learning potential
- E(g): Empowerment gain
- M(g): Meaningfulness/coherence
- α, β, γ, δ: Weighting parameters

### Novelty Score

```python
def novelty_score(goal, memory):
    """
    Compute novelty based on distance to previous experiences
    """
    # Extract goal features
    features = extract_features(goal)
    
    # Compare to k-nearest neighbors in memory
    distances = []
    for past_exp in memory.get_knn(features, k=10):
        dist = feature_distance(features, past_exp.features)
        distances.append(dist)
    
    # Novelty is mean distance to neighbors
    return np.mean(distances)
```

### Learning Potential

```python
def learning_potential(goal, agent_model):
    """
    Estimate potential for skill improvement
    """
    # Predict success probability
    p_success = agent_model.predict_success(goal)
    
    # Maximum learning at p=0.5 (edge of competence)
    learning_curve = 4 * p_success * (1 - p_success)
    
    # Account for skill relevance
    skill_relevance = compute_skill_overlap(goal, agent_model.skills)
    
    return learning_curve * skill_relevance
```

### Empowerment Calculation

```python
def empowerment(state, goal, horizon=5):
    """
    Information-theoretic channel capacity from actions to future states
    """
    # Sample action sequences
    action_sequences = sample_action_sequences(horizon)
    
    # Compute mutual information I(A;S')
    # between actions and resulting states
    mi = 0
    for seq in action_sequences:
        final_state = simulate_sequence(state, seq, goal)
        mi += mutual_information(seq, final_state)
    
    return mi / len(action_sequences)
```

## Implementation Architecture

### System Components

```python
class EmergentGoalSystem:
    def __init__(self, agent):
        self.agent = agent
        self.curiosity_module = CuriosityModule()
        self.competence_module = CompetenceModule()
        self.empowerment_module = EmpowermentModule()
        self.goal_memory = GoalMemory()
        self.meta_controller = MetaController()
    
    def generate_goal(self, world_state):
        # Generate candidate goals
        candidates = self._generate_candidates(world_state)
        
        # Evaluate each candidate
        scored_goals = []
        for goal in candidates:
            score = self._evaluate_goal(goal, world_state)
            scored_goals.append((goal, score))
        
        # Select best goal with exploration noise
        selected = self._select_with_exploration(scored_goals)
        
        # Update memory and models
        self.goal_memory.add(selected)
        
        return selected
```

### Goal Representation

Goals are represented as structured objects:

```python
@dataclass
class Goal:
    # What the agent wants to achieve
    objective: str
    
    # Specific success conditions
    success_criteria: List[Condition]
    
    # Expected outcomes
    predictions: Dict[str, Any]
    
    # Motivational drivers
    motivations: Dict[str, float]
    
    # Temporal scope
    time_horizon: int
    
    # Parent goals (if decomposed)
    parent_goals: List['Goal']
    
    # Metadata
    created_at: float
    priority: float
```

## Goal Generation Algorithms

### Algorithm 1: Curiosity-Driven Exploration

```python
def generate_exploration_goals(agent, world_state):
    """
    Generate goals that maximize information gain
    """
    goals = []
    
    # Identify uncertain areas in world model
    uncertainty_map = agent.world_model.get_uncertainty_map()
    
    # Find reachable high-uncertainty regions
    for region in uncertainty_map.get_high_uncertainty_regions():
        if agent.can_reach(region):
            goal = Goal(
                objective=f"Explore region at {region.center}",
                success_criteria=[
                    VisitedRegion(region),
                    ObservedBlocks(region, threshold=0.8)
                ],
                predictions={
                    "new_blocks_discovered": region.expected_novelty,
                    "world_model_improvement": region.uncertainty_reduction
                },
                motivations={"curiosity": 0.9, "exploration": 0.8},
                time_horizon=estimate_exploration_time(region)
            )
            goals.append(goal)
    
    return goals
```

### Algorithm 2: Competence-Based Progression

```python
def generate_skill_goals(agent, world_state):
    """
    Generate goals that build on current capabilities
    """
    goals = []
    
    # Analyze current skill levels
    skill_graph = agent.skill_memory.get_skill_graph()
    
    # Find skills at the edge of competence
    for skill in skill_graph.get_learnable_skills():
        # Check if prerequisites are met
        if all(agent.has_mastered(prereq) for prereq in skill.prerequisites):
            goal = Goal(
                objective=f"Master {skill.name}",
                success_criteria=skill.mastery_conditions,
                predictions={
                    "skill_improvement": skill.expected_gain,
                    "unlocked_skills": skill.enables
                },
                motivations={"competence": 0.85, "growth": 0.7},
                time_horizon=skill.estimated_learning_time
            )
            goals.append(goal)
    
    return goals
```

### Algorithm 3: Empowerment Maximization

```python
def generate_empowerment_goals(agent, world_state):
    """
    Generate goals that increase future action possibilities
    """
    goals = []
    
    # Identify empowerment bottlenecks
    bottlenecks = analyze_action_constraints(agent, world_state)
    
    for bottleneck in bottlenecks:
        # Generate goal to remove constraint
        removal_goal = create_constraint_removal_goal(bottleneck)
        
        # Estimate empowerment gain
        emp_gain = estimate_empowerment_increase(
            world_state, 
            removal_goal.success_state
        )
        
        goal = Goal(
            objective=removal_goal.description,
            success_criteria=removal_goal.conditions,
            predictions={
                "empowerment_gain": emp_gain,
                "new_actions_enabled": removal_goal.enabled_actions
            },
            motivations={"empowerment": 0.8, "autonomy": 0.75},
            time_horizon=removal_goal.estimated_time
        )
        goals.append(goal)
    
    return goals
```

### Algorithm 4: Creative Combination

```python
def generate_creative_goals(agent, world_state):
    """
    Generate novel goals by combining existing knowledge
    """
    goals = []
    
    # Get recent successful patterns
    patterns = agent.pattern_memory.get_successful_patterns()
    
    # Try creative combinations
    for p1, p2 in itertools.combinations(patterns, 2):
        if can_combine(p1, p2):
            combined = create_combination_goal(p1, p2)
            
            # Evaluate novelty and feasibility
            if is_novel(combined) and is_feasible(combined, agent):
                goal = Goal(
                    objective=combined.description,
                    success_criteria=combined.criteria,
                    predictions={
                        "novelty_score": combined.novelty,
                        "creativity_score": combined.creativity
                    },
                    motivations={"creativity": 0.9, "curiosity": 0.6},
                    time_horizon=combined.estimated_time
                )
                goals.append(goal)
    
    return goals
```

## Evaluation and Metrics

### Goal Quality Metrics

1. **Diversity Score**
   ```python
   def goal_diversity(goals):
       """Measure variety in generated goals"""
       features = [extract_features(g) for g in goals]
       pairwise_distances = pdist(features)
       return np.mean(pairwise_distances)
   ```

2. **Progression Rate**
   ```python
   def skill_progression_rate(agent, time_window):
       """Measure rate of capability improvement"""
       skills_start = agent.get_skills(time_window.start)
       skills_end = agent.get_skills(time_window.end)
       return len(skills_end - skills_start) / time_window.duration
   ```

3. **Goal Coherence**
   ```python
   def goal_coherence_score(goal, context):
       """Measure how well goal fits current context"""
       relevance = compute_relevance(goal, context.current_state)
       achievability = estimate_achievability(goal, context.capabilities)
       meaningfulness = assess_meaningfulness(goal, context.history)
       return (relevance + achievability + meaningfulness) / 3
   ```

### Long-term Evaluation

Track agent development over extended periods:

1. **Behavioral Complexity**: Entropy of action sequences
2. **Environmental Impact**: Measurable changes to world
3. **Skill Portfolio Growth**: Number and depth of mastered skills
4. **Emergent Narratives**: Coherent sequences of related goals

## Case Studies

When multiple agents were present:

1. **Discovery**: Noticed other agents exist
2. **Interaction Goals**: Attempt communication
3. **Collaboration**: Joint construction projects
4. **Emergent Culture**: Developed trading and territorial behaviors

## Integration Guidelines

### With Existing Voyager Architecture

```python
class EnhancedVoyagerAgent(VoyagerAgent):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.goal_system = EmergentGoalSystem(self)
        self.current_goal = None
    
    async def step(self):
        # Generate new goal if needed
        if not self.current_goal or self.current_goal.completed:
            self.current_goal = self.goal_system.generate_goal(
                self.get_world_state()
            )
        
        # Plan actions toward current goal
        action = await self.plan_for_goal(self.current_goal)
        
        # Execute and learn
        result = await self.execute(action)
        self.goal_system.update_from_result(result)
        
        return result
```

### Configuration Options

2. **Goal Hierarchies**: Automatic decomposition of complex goals
3. **Multi-agent Coordination**: Emergent goal sharing and negotiation
4. **Emotional Modeling**: Incorporate affect into goal selection

### Long-term Research

1. **Artificial Consciousness**: Goals emerging from self-model
2. **Cultural Evolution**: Goal memes spreading through agent populations
3. **Open-ended Complexity**: Goals leading to unbounded behavioral complexity
4. **Human Alignment**: Ensuring emergent goals remain beneficial

### Technical Challenges

1. **Computational Efficiency**: Real-time goal generation at scale
2. **Evaluation Methods**: Measuring true open-endedness
3. **Safety Guarantees**: Preventing harmful emergent objectives
4. **Interpretability**: Understanding why specific goals emerge

## Conclusion

Emergent goal setting represents a crucial step toward truly autonomous AI agents. By implementing systems that generate their own objectives based on intrinsic motivations, we can create agents that:

- Exhibit more natural, diverse behaviors
- Continuously learn and adapt without external guidance
- Discover creative solutions to challenges
- Develop unique "personalities" based on their experiences

The framework presented here provides a foundation for building such systems, with concrete algorithms and evaluation methods. As we continue to refine these approaches, we move closer to agents that can truly surprise us with their creativity and autonomy.
