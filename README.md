## 🚀 What's This About?

Imagine an AI that starts knowing nothing about the voxel world, then gradually learns to chop trees, craft tools, build shelters, and maybe even create things we never imagined. That's Luanti Voyager - a wild experiment in letting language models loose in the open-source Luanti sandbox.

Inspired by MineDojo's Voyager but built on fully open foundations, this project is whatever we make it together!

### The Dream

✨ **Agents that learn by doing** - No pre-programmed behaviors, just curiosity and code
🧠 **Any LLM, any approach** - OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, or something completely new
📚 **Growing skill libraries** - Each agent builds on what came before
🔓 **Radically open** - Fork it, break it, make it weird
🚀 **Fast experimentation** - Craftium gives us thousands of steps per second

## 🎮 Why This Matters

### The Moment is Now

- **Voyager showed the way** - LLMs can actually play and learn
- **Luanti is ready** - Mature, moddable, and truly open
- **Craftium unlocked speed** - Research-grade performance in a voxel world
- **The community is hungry** - People want to build crazy AI experiments

### Why Open Source Changes Everything

- **No corporate overlords** - We own this completely
- **Mod anything** - The engine itself is our playground
- **Run anywhere** - Your laptop, a Pi cluster, or the cloud
- **Share everything** - Skills, worlds, and wild ideas

## 🏗️ How It Works (The Simple Version)

```
Luanti World ←→ Craftium Magic ←→ Your Agent's Brain
```

The agent sees the world, thinks about what to do (using whatever LLM you want), tries stuff, and remembers what worked. That's it!

### The Fun Parts

🌍 **World Interface** - Your agent sees blocks, entities, inventory
🤔 **Brain Options** - Any LLM, any prompting strategy, any crazy idea
🎮 **Actions** - Move, dig, place, craft, and whatever else we dream up
💾 **Memory** - Save skills, share with others, build on previous work

## 🚀 Jump In!

### The Basics

```bash
# Grab the code
git clone --recursive https://github.com/toddllm/luanti-voyager.git
cd luanti-voyager

# Set up Python (however you like)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install stuff
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run your first agent!
python -m luanti_voyager.main
```

That's it! The agent will start exploring. Want to use GPT-4? Set your API key. Want to use a local model? Go for it. Want to try something completely different? Please do!

### Make It Your Own

- **Change the world**: Flat, mountains, custom, whatever
- **Change the brain**: Different LLMs, prompting strategies, or even non-LLM approaches
- **Change the goals**: Survival, building, art, chaos
- **Change everything**: This is YOUR experiment

## 🗺️ Where We're Going

### Right Now - Get It Working

- [ ] Agents that mod the game
- [ ] Completely new architectures
- [ ] Things we haven't imagined yet

### Always - Keep It Fun
- [ ] Wild experiments
- [ ] Silly projects
- [ ] Unexpected discoveries
- [ ] Community first

### How to Contribute

**Literally anything helps:**
- 💡 Share a crazy idea
- 🐛 Break something and tell us about it
- 🎨 Make it beautiful
- 🧪 Try weird experiments
- 📹 Record your agent doing something cool
- 🗣️ Tell your friends

**No contribution is too small or too weird!**

## 📊 How We'll Know It's Working

- **It survives longer than 5 minutes**
- **It learns something new**
- **It surprises us**
- **Someone says "whoa, I didn't expect that"**
- **The community gets excited**

We'll figure out proper benchmarks later. For now, let's just build cool stuff!

## 🌟 Join the Party
