# Implementation Guide: Integrating Guardrails into Luanti Voyager with AI Agents

## Executive Summary

This guide outlines a comprehensive approach for integrating advanced guardrails into Luanti Voyager, an open-source Minecraft-like game that utilizes AI agents. By leveraging pre-trained language models from Hugging Face, we aim to enhance the decision-making capabilities of these agents within the game environment, ensuring they adhere to predefined ethical and functional guidelines (guardrails). This integration will enable more robust, predictable, and engaging interactions between players and AI entities.

Guardrails in this context refer to constraints and rules that ensure the behavior of AI agents remains aligned with desired outcomes, such as preventing harmful or unintended actions while allowing for intelligent and adaptive gameplay. By implementing these guardrails, we can create a safer and more enjoyable gaming experience for all players.

## Core Architecture

The core architecture involves adapting the notebook-based code to fit within Luanti Voyager's game loop and AI system. The key components include:

1. **Language Model Integration**: Embedding a pre-trained language model (e.g., AFM-4.5B) into the game backend to process natural language inputs and generate responses.
2. **Guardrails Definition**: Defining rules and constraints that dictate acceptable behaviors for AI agents, ensuring they operate within specified parameters.
3. **Game State Awareness**: Incorporating real-time game state data (e.g., player positions, inventory contents) into the input prompts for the language model to make contextually appropriate decisions.

## Detailed Implementation

### Step-by-Step Adaptation

1. **Model Initialization**:
   ```python
   from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
   import torch

   model_id = "arcee-ai/AFM-4.5B"
   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
   model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
       model_id,
       torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
       device_map="auto"
   )
   ```

2. **Input Preparation**:
   ```python
   def prepare_input(messages):
       input_ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
           messages,
           add_generation_prompt=True,
           return_tensors="pt"
       ).to(model.device)
       return input_ids
   ```

3. **Response Generation**:
   ```python
   def generate_response(input_ids, max_tokens=1024):
       outputs = model.generate(
           input_ids,
           max_new_tokens=max_tokens,
           do_sample=True,
           temperature=0.5,
           top_k=50,
           top_p=0.95
       )
       response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
       return response
   ```

4. **Integration with Game Logic**:
   ```python
   def get_ai_decision(game_state, query):
       messages = [
           {"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agent in Luanti Voyager."},
           {"role": "user", "content": game_state},
           {"role": "assistant", "content": "Understood. What would you like to do?"},
           {"role": "user", "content": query}
       ]
       input_ids = prepare_input(messages)
       response = generate_response(input_ids, max_tokens=512)
       return response
   ```

### Example Usage within Game Loop

```python
def game_loop():
    game_state = "You are in a forest. You see an enemy approaching."
    query = "What should I do?"

    decision = get_ai_decision(game_state, query)
    print(f"AI Decision: {decision}")

    # Execute the decision within the game logic
    # ...
```

## Game-Specific Adaptations

To adapt this implementation to a Minecraft-like environment, consider the following modifications:

1. **Contextual Prompts**:
   - Include detailed descriptions of the player's surroundings, inventory, health, and current objectives.
   ```python
   def get_minecraft_context(player):
       context = f"You are in {player.location}. You have {player.inventory} items. Your health is {player.health}."
       return context
   ```

2. **Guardrails for Minecraft**:
   - Define specific rules to prevent harmful actions, such as not attacking neutral mobs or destroying important structures.
   ```python
   def apply_guardrails(response):
       if "attack" in response and "neutral mob" in response:
           return "It's better not to attack neutral mobs."
       return response
   ```

3. **Integration with Minecraft API**:
   - Use the Minecraft API to execute decisions made by AI agents, such as moving, crafting, or interacting with objects.
   ```python
   def execute_decision(player, decision):
       if "move" in decision:
           # Move player based on decision
           pass
       elif "craft" in decision:
           # Craft item based on decision
           pass
       # ...
   ```

## Integration Points

The language model and guardrails should be integrated into the game's AI system, specifically:

1. **AI Decision Making**:
   - At each decision point (e.g., player interaction, enemy encounter), invoke the `get_ai_decision` function to generate a response.
   
2. **Event Handling**:
   - Handle specific events within the game (e.g., chat messages, combat scenarios) by feeding relevant information to the language model.

3. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - Continuously update the game state and feed it into the language model to ensure contextually accurate responses.

## Performance Considerations

1. **Model Optimization**:
   - Utilize quantization or other optimization techniques to reduce the computational load of the language model.
   
2. **Asynchronous Processing**:
   - Process AI decisions asynchronously to avoid blocking the main game loop, ensuring smooth gameplay.

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Monitor GPU and CPU usage to ensure the language model does not degrade overall performance significantly.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Write unit tests for individual functions (e.g., `prepare_input`, `generate_response`) to verify their correctness.

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Perform integration tests within the game environment to ensure AI decisions are correctly executed and guardrails are properly enforced.

3. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Conduct user acceptance testing with a diverse group of players to gather feedback on AI behavior and make necessary adjustments.

4. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Continuously monitor performance metrics (e.g., frame rate, response time) during gameplay to identify bottlenecks or issues.

## Example Use Cases

1. **Player Interaction**:
   - When a player approaches an NPC, the AI agent can generate a dialogue response based on the player's current quest and inventory.
   ```python
   game_state = "You are talking to a villager in the village."
   query = "Do you have any quests for me?"
   decision = get_ai_decision(game_state, query)
   print(f"Villager: {decision}")
   ```

2. **Combat Scenarios**:
   - During combat, AI agents can make strategic decisions based on enemy types and player health.
   ```python
   game_state = "You are in a battle with zombies."
   query = "Should I use a potion?"
   decision = get_ai_decision(game_state, query)
   print(f"AI Decision: {decision}")
   ```

3. **Crafting Assistance**:
   - When a player is crafting, AI agents can suggest recipes or items based on available resources.
   ```python
   game_state = "You are at a crafting table with wood and string."
   query = "What should I make?"
   decision = get_ai_decision(game_state, query)
   print(f"AI Decision: {decision}")
   ```

4. **Exploration Guidance**:
   - When exploring new areas, AI agents can provide guidance on where to go next based on player objectives and map information.
   ```python
   game_state = "You are in a dense forest with no landmarks."
   query = "Which direction should I go?"
   decision = get_ai_decision(game_state, query)
   print(f"AI Decision: {decision}")
   ```

By following this comprehensive implementation guide, developers can successfully integrate advanced guardrails into Luanti Voyager, enhancing the capabilities and behavior of AI agents within the game environment. This approach ensures that AI entities operate ethically and effectively, contributing to a more engaging and enjoyable gaming experience for all players.
