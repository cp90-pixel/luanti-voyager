**Introduction:** We envision an AI agent in a voxel sandbox (Luanti/Minetest) that learns **neurosymbolic skills** – blending neural network reasoning with symbolic, code-based actions – to achieve open-ended goals safely. State-of-the-art systems like **Voyager** have demonstrated the power of using an LLM (GPT-4) to generate executable code as actions in Minecraft, yielding an *ever-growing skill library*, automatic task curriculum, and iterative self-improvement from failures. **Code-as-Policies** showed that large language models can translate natural language commands into robot **policy code**, chaining API calls and logic to handle novel tasks with spatial reasoning. And approaches like **Toolformer** train models to invoke external tools (APIs) as needed during reasoning, enhancing accuracy and capability. Building on these, we will design a system where the agent writes and refines code to fulfill goals, learns from success and failure, composes simpler skills into complex routines, and maintains a versioned library of skills. We emphasize safety at every step: code generation is validated and constrained to prevent harmful actions. Below, we detail each aspect of the design and propose innovations that push beyond the current state of the art.

## 1. Skill Representation Format (Neural + Symbolic)

**Symbolic Code as Skills:** Each skill will be represented as **executable code** (in Lua or Python) that the agent can call, akin to a function or subroutine implementing a specific behavior. This draws on Voyager's design where *"programs \[code] represent temporally extended and compositional actions"* in the world. By using code as a **symbolic representation**, skills are *interpretable* (human-readable) and can encode logical structure (loops, conditions) explicitly. For example, a skill `build_bridge()` might contain a loop placing blocks over a gap, and a skill `craft_item("axe")` might contain a sequence of checks and crafting API calls. Such **symbolic skill scripts** provide clarity and can enforce constraints (e.g. don't place blocks on protected structures) directly via logic. Notably, this symbolic format supports **safety and reasoning** – as noted in a recent overview, symbolic reasoning can embed hard rules (like safety limits), avoiding catastrophic failures that a black-box policy might produce.

**Neural Annotations and Embeddings:** To incorporate neural aspects, each skill will also carry *metadata* learned by the agent. This includes a **natural-language description** (e.g. "build a 5-block stone bridge over a gap") and a **neural embedding** of that description for easy retrieval. Voyager similarly indexed each skill by an embedding of its description, enabling the agent to retrieve relevant skills in future situations. The embedding (a vector representation) is produced by an LLM or encoder and allows **fuzzy matching**: when a new goal arises, the agent can find the closest related skills by description. This is the *neural* side of the representation, facilitating generalization – the agent doesn't rely purely on exact symbolic names, but can semantically search its skill library. Additionally, the agent's LLM reasoning module can use these descriptions to decide which skill to invoke or how to modify it, effectively treating skill calls as *actions in its thought process*.

**Hybrid (Neurosymbolic) Structure:** Each skill can thus be seen as a **neurosymbolic object**: a piece of code (symbolic) that can call low-level API actions or other skills, combined with learned parameters or models as needed. For instance, if a skill involves a perceptual trigger (e.g. "if you see lava, build a wall"), a small neural network could be embedded to recognize the pattern in the JSON state, outputting a Boolean that the code checks. Generally, perceptual tasks (vision, recognition of complex patterns in state) can be handled by neural submodules, while the high-level decision logic is in code. This approach aligns with broader neurosymbolic AI trends in robotics: high-level plans or logic are symbolic, grounded by neural perception and control modules. It allows *learning within structure*: the agent can improve a neural sub-component (like a pathfinding heuristic or a state classifier) through learning, without changing the outer code skeleton.

**Hierarchy and Abstraction:** The skill representation should support **hierarchical composition**. Simple atomic skills (e.g. "move forward one step", "place block") form the foundation, and more complex skills build on them (e.g. "build bridge" calls "move" and "place block" repeatedly). The code format makes this natural – one function can call another. We will impose a clear interface for each skill (inputs, outputs, or using the agent's world state as input and returning success/failure), so they behave like modular components. This enables the agent (or the LLM) to treat skills as *atomic actions* when planning higher-level behaviors. Over time, the library may develop multiple layers of abstraction (like a hierarchy: navigation skills, building skills, crafting skills, etc.), which is analogous to how humans write subroutines to handle sub-problems. Maintaining these as code ensures that the logic of each step is understandable and verifiable.

**Versioning of Skills:** To allow continuous improvement without catastrophic forgetting, the skill library will be **version-controlled**. Each skill starts at version 1.0 upon first successful creation. If the agent learns a better way or needs to adapt the skill, it can create a new version (1.1, 1.2, etc.) rather than overwriting the old one. This versioning (along with date or context stamps) acts as a form of memory: the agent can compare performance of different versions and roll back if a new version fails unexpectedly. It also encourages **experimentation** – the agent might branch a skill into two strategies (e.g., a mining skill that tries a new optimization) and retain both until one proves consistently superior. Storing multiple versions safely addresses the *credit assignment* of learning: the agent won't lose a previously working solution while exploring improvements. This idea goes beyond current systems like Voyager (which stored only the latest working code for a task) by explicitly preserving skill evolution. In practice, we might implement this with a simple naming scheme (e.g. `craft_item_v1`, `craft_item_v2`) or a git-like system for code, including commit messages generated by the agent describing changes.

**Documentation and Metadata:** Each skill's code will be accompanied by a *docstring* or comment that describes its purpose, author (agent) and conditions of use. For instance: `-- Skill: craft_item(item_name): Crafts the specified item if ingredients available. Version 1.2 learned after failure in low wood scenario.` This aids both the agent's LLM (which can read these descriptions when deciding how to use or modify the skill) and human developers inspecting the library. Recent research (e.g. MIT's LILO framework) suggests that documenting and compressing code into libraries of succinct abstractions greatly helps reuse and understanding. Over time, as the skill library grows, the agent could even apply **automatic refactoring**: analyzing code to merge duplicate logic into new sub-skills (as done by library learning algorithms like DreamCoder). This means the skill representation isn't static; the agent can reorganize and simplify its skills, creating new symbolic abstractions that cover multiple earlier skills – effectively **learning new symbols** that make higher-level reasoning easier.

## 2. Safe Code Generation Pipeline with Validation

Generating executable code from a natural language goal is powerful but risky – so our design includes a rigorous **code generation pipeline with safety validation** at multiple stages. The pipeline ensures the agent's code *does what it's supposed to* and *nothing more*. Here's the proposed process:

1. **Goal Interpretation:** The agent receives a high-level goal (e.g. "Build a shelter near water without harming the environment"). The LLM-based reasoning module first interprets this request, possibly breaking it into subgoals or retrieving relevant skill descriptions. This step is akin to planning: the agent might generate a pseudocode outline or a chain-of-thought describing how to achieve the goal safely. For instance, it might reason: "To build a shelter: need to find water, then choose a flat area, gather wood, then construct walls and roof. Ensure not to destroy any existing structures or forests unnecessarily." This plan can be reviewed (even by a human or a safety script) before actual code is written, serving as a **sanity check** on the approach.

2. **Code Generation via LLM:** Next, the agent prompts the LLM to generate actual **executable code** (in Lua/Python) to implement the plan. We use few-shot examples and a constrained coding style in the prompt to guide the LLM. For example, the prompt can include: *"# Goal: Build a shelter by water (safe). # Plan: 1) locate water… 4) place blocks… # Code:"* followed by known API calls (`move()`, `place_block()`, etc.). The LLM then outputs a candidate program. Notably, we instruct the LLM (via system prompt or fine-tuning) to **avoid dangerous actions** – e.g. do not call any API outside a whitelist, do not mine or place lava (if such an action exists) unless explicitly allowed, and include checks if an action might cause large destruction. This is a form of *policy shaping* at generation time for safety. For instance, the LLM might include a check like `if inventory.contains("wood")` before chopping a tree, to avoid deforesting if wood is already available.

3. **Static Analysis and Constraints Check:** Once code is generated, we perform an automatic **static analysis** on it *before* execution. This involves scanning the code for any disallowed patterns or potential errors. For example, we look for infinite loops, use of forbidden API calls, or missing resource checks. We can leverage a static analyzer tool or even an LLM-based code reviewer. In fact, a recent approach called *AutoSafeCoder* used a multi-agent system where one agent generates code and another acts as a static analysis expert to catch vulnerabilities. We adopt a similar idea: have a *"Safety Agent"* (which could be an LLM prompted as a code auditor) inspect the generated code and flag issues. Issues might include: *"This code tries to mine a block without checking if it's necessary"* or *"Potential null index at line 10"*. The static check stage ensures the code meets certain **safety rules** and coding standards *a priori*. If it fails, the code is sent back for revision: the LLM gets feedback or warnings and must regenerate or fix the problematic sections.

4. **Simulated Dry Run (Optional):** For further caution, especially for complex skills, the system can execute the code in a **sandbox or simulation mode** to foresee its effects. If the environment allows cloning or simulating (in a voxel world, we might simulate in a separate, non-persistent copy of the world state), we run the code step by step virtually. We observe the outcomes: Did the agent attempt to break a protected block? Did it run into an error? Did it achieve the subgoals in simulation? This provides *dynamic validation*. If any unsafe or unintended effect is observed in the dry run, we halt and mark the code as unvalidated.

5. **Execution with Monitoring:** If static (and optional simulated) validation passes, the agent executes the code in the real environment. It does so under **monitoring**: a watchdog process tracks the actions and can intervene if something goes awry (e.g., if the agent suddenly tries to mine an out-of-bounds area or if an unforeseen infinite loop happens, we can stop execution). During execution, the agent logs outcomes of each step (success or failure of API calls, changes in world state). This log is crucial for learning from failures.

6. **Runtime Error Handling:** If the code hits an **error** (exception or logical failure), the system catches it and pauses execution. The error (e.g., "no such item to craft" or "index out of range") is fed back into the LLM along with the code context. This mirrors Voyager's *iterative prompting mechanism* where *"if the generated code fails, GPT-4 is prompted again with the error feedback to improve the program"*. The LLM uses the error message to debug and suggest a fix. For example, if the error is "water not found," the LLM might alter the strategy (perhaps look for a different water source or skip if none nearby). This iterative refine-and-run loop continues until the code executes successfully or a certain number of attempts is reached. Crucially, this means the agent **learns from failures**: each failure is an opportunity to refine the skill's robustness. Over time, the skill code accumulates checks and alternative behaviors for edge cases that caused past failures.

7. **Self-Verification Check:** Even if the code runs without crashing, we add a final **outcome verification** step. We prompt the LLM (or a separate verifier model) with the goal, the executed code, and the observed end state, asking: *"Did this code successfully achieve the goal? Could it be done more safely or efficiently?"* This is inspired by Voyager's self-verification, where *GPT-4 was asked to act as a critic given the task and current state, confirming if the program achieves the task or suggesting improvements*. For example, the agent might finish building a shelter but the verifier notices the shelter has no door – technically a shelter but perhaps improvable. Or the verifier might confirm success but note a safety issue: "The shelter was built, but it required cutting 10 trees; perhaps in the future limit deforestation." These critiques are used to update the skill or to record warnings. This *quality assurance* step pushes the agent from just "working code" to **optimal and safe code**.

8. **Skill Library Update:** If the code ultimately succeeds and passes verification, it is saved into the skill library (with a new version number if it was an update). The system also stores the test cases (initial state and goal) that were used to validate it. These become part of that skill's *regression tests*: in the future, if the skill is modified, we can re-run these tests to ensure it still works (ensuring new learning doesn't break old capabilities).

Through this pipeline, we combine *neural generation* with *symbolic and programmatic validation*. The agent is essentially performing a mini software development cycle for each skill: write code, test it (both statically and dynamically), fix bugs, and review the outcome. This approach aligns with recent frameworks that use testing and static analysis feedback to improve LLM-generated code. In those studies, models often failed to self-detect errors but could fix code when given explicit test or analysis feedback. We leverage that capability here. Moreover, by treating unsafe actions as "bugs," we enforce safety as a first-class requirement. Importantly, the *symbolic nature* of skills makes such analysis feasible – unlike a black-box policy network, code can be inspected and reasoned about before execution.

**Environmental Safety Constraints:** In addition to the pipeline above, we embed domain-specific safety policies. For a voxel world, "not damaging the environment" can be formalized: e.g., do not destroy blocks unless necessary for a task, never grief structures, avoid killing passive creatures, etc. These can be hard-coded checks in the APIs. For instance, the `mine_block(x,y,z)` action can refuse to break a block if that block is tagged as protected or if breaking it would cause a large avalanche. The agent's code thus might attempt an unsafe action, but the environment API itself can veto it (returning an error or no-op). The agent would then learn that such actions are ineffective, and through error feedback, it will adjust strategy (e.g., *"failed to mine protected block"* leads the agent to try a different approach). This two-layer safety – **policy at generation time** (LLM instructed not to produce certain code) and **checks at execution time** (environment constraints) – greatly minimizes the chance of accidental damage. It's analogous to how robotics researchers incorporate hard safety constraints even if the policy is learned.

Finally, as an innovation, the agent could use **external tool APIs for safety** – inspired by Toolformer's idea of calling tools mid-reasoning. For example, the agent might call a *"safetyForecast()"* tool that predicts the consequences of a proposed action (like a physics simulator or a script that estimates how many blocks will be affected by a dig). If the forecast looks bad (e.g., avalanche likely), the agent can revise its plan before execution. Incorporating such tool-use at decision time would push beyond current systems (which largely rely on either learned knowledge or trial and error) by giving the agent an explicit foresight ability for safety.

## 3. Skill Composition and Dependency Management

As the agent acquires a repertoire of simple skills, it must **compose** them to tackle more complex tasks. We will design a system of skill composition that treats the skill library as building blocks and carefully manages dependencies between skills (especially as they evolve in versions).

**Composing Simple Skills into Complex Behaviors:** Composition can occur implicitly when the LLM generates code for a new high-level task: instead of writing everything from scratch, it can call existing skills (functions). For instance, if the goal is "Build a fenced house with a door," the agent's code might do: `craft_item("fence")` (calling a known crafting skill), `build_wall()` (calling a building skill), etc., then some new code to assemble them. This yields a new composite skill that orchestrates simpler ones. Voyager demonstrated exactly this: *"Complex skills can be synthesized by composing simpler programs"*, and this rapidly compounded the agent's capabilities. We will encourage this by prompting the LLM with the names and descriptions of relevant existing skills during code generation. Before generating new code, the agent queries the skill library (by embedding similarity or keywords) to get, say, 5 potentially useful skills for the task. It then provides those as context (e.g. "You have functions X, Y, Z available") so the LLM can directly use them. This both saves time and ensures tested routines are reused rather than reinvented.

**Dependency Tracking:** Every time a skill calls another skill, we log that as a dependency (edge in a graph). This allows the system to understand, for example, that `build_house` depends on `craft_item` and `build_wall`. With versioned skills, we annotate the dependency with version numbers too (build\_house v1.0 uses craft\_item v1.2). This is important for **maintenance**: if `craft_item` gets improved (v1.3), we might want to test if `build_house` still works with the new version or if it should stick to the older version. We can automate this by re-running `build_house`'s test cases whenever a dependency is updated. If something breaks, the agent's LLM is tasked with modifying `build_house` to be compatible with the new `craft_item` (or the system might decide to keep using the older version for stability). This approach is akin to software dependency management in continuous integration systems. It prevents the common issue of *cascading failures*: one change in a low-level skill unexpectedly causing higher-level skills to fail. By testing and updating dependencies in lockstep, the library remains **consistent**.

**Hierarchical Organization:** We expect skills to naturally cluster by domain (mining, crafting, building, navigation, etc.) or by complexity level. We can explicitly organize the library in a directory-like structure or tag system (for example, tag `basic` vs `advanced`, or group skills by their primary action). This doesn't just aid the agent's retrieval; it also helps with **curriculum** (as we discuss later) by identifying which simpler skills should be mastered before attempting a complex one. Dependencies should mostly flow from basic to advanced (to avoid cyclic calls). If we detect a cycle (skill A uses B and B uses A), that's likely a design mistake – we'd have the LLM refactor to break the loop (maybe merge them or create a lower-level helper skill both can use). This keeps the dependency graph a directed acyclic graph (DAG), supporting clear hierarchies.

**Skill Generalization vs Specialization:** When composing skills, a question arises: should the agent create a new specialized skill for a specific complex task, or re-use and parameterize existing skills? We prefer **general, parameterized skills** when possible. For example, instead of `build_small_house` and `build_large_house` as separate, the agent could have one `build_house(size)` skill. The LLM can be prompted to abstract when it notices repetition. If it generated two similar code blocks for two tasks, it might refactor into one function with a parameter (some LLM prompting or a refactoring step can handle this). This keeps the skill library concise and each skill more broadly applicable. However, the agent might still keep specialized variants if optimizing for efficiency or if a generalized version becomes too complex or less reliable. We allow co-existence but mark specialized skills clearly in their description (e.g., "build\_tower: specialized for cylindrical structures").

**Version Control and Branching:** With versioning, an interesting strategy is **A/B testing of skill versions**. Suppose skill `navigate_to(x,y,z)` has v1 (a straightforward approach) and the agent develops v2 (perhaps a more efficient pathfinding). Rather than immediately discarding v1, the agent can keep both and use each in different trials to empirically see which performs better under various conditions. Metrics (like success rate or time taken) can be logged. If v2 consistently outperforms, it becomes the default and v1 can be deprecated (but archived). If v2 has some regressions, the agent might decide to use v1 for certain cases (maybe the agent learns a rule: "use nav v1 in caves, v2 in open terrain"). This kind of **dynamic dependency resolution** (choosing which version to call at runtime based on context) could be an innovation beyond current practice. Essentially the agent becomes a meta-learner over its skill implementations.

**Dependency of Learning (Curriculum):** We also manage dependencies in the *learning sequence*. Before attempting to learn a new skill, the curriculum module checks that prerequisite skills are in place. For example, it's unwise to attempt "craft an iron pickaxe" if the agent has not yet learned how to smelt iron or craft basic tools. The curriculum (discussed in section 5) will propose tasks in an order that respects dependency: ensuring simpler skills (or prerequisites like resource availability) are ready. If a high-level goal is given out-of-order by a human, the agent should break it down and possibly defer subtasks until prerequisites are learned. This way, skill composition is built on a solid foundation.

**Library as a Knowledge Base:** Over time, the skill library itself serves as a form of **knowledge base** for the agent. It encodes what the agent "knows" how to do. We plan to leverage this by enabling the agent to do *introspective queries*. For example, if given a novel goal, the agent can query its library: "Which skills might be useful for achieving this?" (via embedding search as mentioned). Or ask: "Do I know how to do X? If not, what simpler tasks should I learn first?" This could be powered by the LLM reading the list of skill descriptions and gap-finding. This self-reflection can drive *targeted learning*: the agent identifies missing capabilities and triggers new skill learning cycles for those. Such capability-aware behavior goes beyond the reactive nature of current systems and moves toward **autonomous skill discovery** (similar to how Voyager's GPT-4 proposes new tasks that yield novel skills).

**Innovations Beyond SOTA in Composition:** In current systems (like Voyager), skill composition was largely implicit via code reuse and the skill library is flat. We propose to extend this with explicit **dependency management tools** (like versioning, testing dependencies, conditional version use) to maintain long-term reliability. Another innovation is to incorporate **classical planning or symbolic reasoning** for composition: for certain complex multi-step tasks, we could have the agent translate the goal into a high-level plan using a planner (for instance, generating a PDDL plan or a task graph) and then bind skills to each step of the plan. This hybrid approach would ensure that if multiple skills are needed in sequence, we systematically find an order that achieves the goal, rather than relying purely on the LLM's generation to get it right. The LLM could generate the plan, and a planner could verify it or suggest reordering if something is off. This kind of integration of LLM with a planner is a cutting-edge idea in neurosymbolic research, marrying data-driven flexibility with symbolic rigor.

## 4. Metrics for Evaluating Skill Quality and Generalization

To measure our agent's progress and the effectiveness of its learned skills, we need clear **metrics**. We will evaluate each skill individually as well as the overall skill library on both **quality** and **generalization**.

**Skill Quality Metrics:** For a given skill (especially as it is versioned and refined), we consider:

* **Success Rate:** How often does the skill achieve its intended outcome when invoked in relevant situations? We can test each skill in a variety of scenarios (some generated via simulation) to estimate a success percentage. A high-quality skill should be reliable across the conditions it's meant for.
* **Efficiency:** Resources or time used. For instance, if two versions of a skill achieve the same outcome, the one that uses fewer actions or less time (or fewer blocks) is better. We quantify efficiency (e.g., average number of steps or CPU ticks to complete).
* **Robustness and Fault-Tolerance:** Does the skill handle edge cases gracefully? We might deliberately introduce minor perturbations (e.g., missing one tool in inventory, or an unexpected obstacle) and see if the skill can still succeed or at least fail safely (without cascading errors). A robust skill might call backup behaviors or report failure without causing chaos.
* **Safety Compliance:** We track if the skill ever violates safety constraints during testing. For example, a count of "unsafe actions attempted" per execution. A well-formed skill should have zero unsafe attempts in normal operation.
* **Interpretablity & Simplicity (Code Quality):** Though harder to quantify, we can have a metric for code complexity (e.g., lines of code, or cyclomatic complexity). Simpler, well-documented code is preferred because it's easier to audit and less likely to hide bugs. We could use static analysis to rate code quality (some tools score code maintainability). Additionally, *human evaluation* of a few skills can be done to ensure they are understandable.
* **Reuse Frequency:** How often is this skill used by other skills or in accomplishing goals? A high-value skill will be reused frequently (like a general navigation or crafting skill), whereas a very narrow skill might rarely be called. While not exactly "quality," usage frequency helps identify which skills are linchpins of the agent's competence and thus should be extra solid. If a skill is rarely used, perhaps it's too specialized or there's overlap with another skill – prompting us to merge or generalize it.

We will aggregate these into a **Skill Scorecard**. For example, *Skill "craft\_item" v1.3:* Success 95%, Efficiency 8 actions avg, Robustness 90% (in 10% of scenarios it fails if fuel missing), Safety 100% (no violations), Lines of code 15 (medium complexity), Reuse: called in 7 other skills. Such a scorecard helps target which skills need improvement (e.g., a low robustness or success rate).

**Generalization Metrics:** Beyond individual skills, we assess how well knowledge transfers to new situations:

* **Cross-Task Generalization:** We will present the agent with entirely new high-level goals that *require recombining learned skills in novel ways*, and see if it can solve them. For instance, if it learned "build bridge" and "defeat monster" separately, can it handle a goal "Cross a river guarded by a monster" (combining combat and bridge-building)? The metric is success/failure on these *unseen combinations*. This tests the compositional capability of the skill library.
* **New World, Same Tasks:** A hallmark of generalization is performing learned behaviors in a fresh environment. We can generate a new world (different terrain, seed) and evaluate if the agent can achieve key tasks from scratch using its learned skills. Voyager showed that its agent could use the learned skill library *"in a new Minecraft world to solve novel tasks from scratch, while other techniques struggled to generalize"*. We will quantify this by measuring, for example, how many of a set of target tasks the agent completes in a new world within a fixed number of trials or time, compared to a baseline (like an agent with no prior skills). A strong generalization metric is zero-shot performance: **Zero-Shot Task Success** – the percentage of new tasks (drawn from the same distribution of goals) the agent can accomplish without additional training. As reported, Voyager was able to zero-shot solve tasks in a new world that baselines could not solve at all. We aim for similarly high zero-shot success.
* **Adaptation to Variations:** We will also test skills under variations of the environment or goal parameters. For example, if "build shelter" was learned in a mild climate, can the agent build an **ice shelter** in a snow biome or a **treehouse shelter** if the ground is lava? Of course, these may require new skills, but we want to see if the agent can at least partially adapt existing skills. We can measure **success rate as environment parameters vary** to identify brittle skills. Ideally, as the agent's library grows, the range of conditions it can handle grows too.
* **Life-Long Learning Metrics:** Since this is a lifelong learning system, we monitor metrics over the agent's lifespan: e.g., **number of unique skills learned** over time, **breadth of task types** solved, and improvement on baseline tasks. A useful metric is the tech-tree or capability milestones: how quickly and how thoroughly does the agent unlock the "tech tree" of the game. Voyager measured that it *unlocked key tech tree milestones up to 15x faster than prior approaches*. We will similarly track milestones (like obtaining stone tools, iron tools, etc. in Minetest) and use those as proxy for skill learning efficacy. Faster unlocking means the curriculum and skill acquisition are effective.

**Library-Wide Metrics:** We can define some metrics for the skill library as a whole:

* **Skill Diversity:** Number of distinct high-level goals the skills cover. Perhaps measured by clustering skill descriptions or by human-defined categories covered.
* **Redundancy:** Are there skills that do overlapping things? Some redundancy is fine (different strategies), but too much might indicate inefficiency. We could measure similarity between skill code or descriptions to flag potential merges.
* **Average Skill Performance:** The aggregate success rate if we attempt all skills in appropriate contexts. If this improves over time, it shows overall learning progress.
* **Catastrophic Forgetting Absence:** Because we keep old skills, forgetting is mitigated. We can test this by periodically re-running old training tasks to ensure the agent still remembers how to do them. We expect near 100% retention since skills are stored – if we find a drop, it means maybe environment changes or subtle bugs have crept in, which we'd address.

**Human Evaluation:** In addition to quantitative metrics, having a human judge the agent's behavior can be insightful. For example, we might look at *qualitative generalization*: did the agent come up with a creative solution using its skills for a novel problem? Does it exhibit **improvisation** (using known skills in an unusual way)? These are hard to score automatically, but scenario-based evaluations can illustrate the agent's level of general intelligence.

Finally, all these metrics will guide the improvement cycle. Skills that score low on generalization or success will be targeted by the learning algorithm for improvement (either more training, more examples, or refactoring). We'll also use metrics to compare against SOTA baselines: e.g., we expect our neurosymbolic agent to outperform pure RL or pure LLM agents on sample efficiency and safety. As a concrete example, we might measure **environmental damage** (number of unnecessary blocks destroyed) per task – our goal is to minimize this, showcasing safe behavior, whereas a baseline agent without safety might score poorly on that metric.

## 5. Curriculum Learning Approach (Progressive Complexity)

To train the agent effectively, we employ a **curriculum learning** strategy that introduces tasks in increasing complexity, allowing the agent to gradually build up its skillset. The curriculum will be **automatic and open-ended**, taking inspiration from Voyager's approach of an LLM-generated task agenda, as well as classical ideas of shaping and scaffolding in reinforcement learning.

**Automatic Task Generation:** Initially, the agent starts with zero or few skills. The curriculum module (potentially an LLM itself) proposes a series of achievable tasks that slightly extend the agent's current capabilities. For example, at the very start: "collect 5 wood blocks" or "walk to that hill" are simple tasks. Once those are mastered and the skills (like basic movement, basic resource gathering) are in the library, the curriculum might propose a next task: "using wood, craft a wooden pickaxe" – combining inventory and crafting. Voyager's method was to have GPT-4 generate tasks based on the agent's state and achieved items, aiming to *"solve progressively harder tasks"*. Similarly, we will prompt a curriculum LLM with the agent's current knowledge (e.g., list of items acquired, skills learned, notable world observations) and ask for a next interesting goal that yields something new. The overarching heuristic, as in Voyager, is *novelty and exploration*: tasks that lead to new items, new areas, or new skill development are prioritized. This can be seen as the agent having an *intrinsic motivation* to discover diverse things.

**Stages of Complexity:** We can outline rough stages:

* **Stage 0: Navigation and Perception:** Goals that teach the agent to move around safely and observe the world (e.g. "explore 10 meters north", "find water and go to it"). This establishes spatial awareness and pathfinding.
* **Stage 1: Basic Manipulation:** Simple interactions like mining and placing blocks, but in a controlled way ("dig a 2x2 hole", "pile 3 blocks on top of each other"). The agent learns the effects of its actions and how to undo/redo constructions.
* **Stage 2: Resource Collection and Crafting:** Goals to gather resources and craft basic tools ("collect wood and craft a crafting table", "use the table to craft a wooden sword"). This introduces multi-step planning and the concept of using tools.
* **Stage 3: Construction and Complex Sequences:** Building structures or accomplishing multi-part tasks ("build a 5x5 wooden hut with a door and a roof"). Here the agent composes earlier skills (gathering, crafting, placing) into longer sequences. Also, possibly introduces safe practices (don't chop all nearby trees, replant if needed).
* **Stage 4: Adversarial or Survival Tasks:** If applicable in the environment, tasks like "survive the night" or "defend against a creature" that force the agent to integrate combat or quick decision-making skills with its toolset. The agent learns to manage hazards (while still being safe in collateral damage).
* **Stage 5: Optimization and Efficiency:** Once the agent can achieve outcomes, we can set challenges to do them better: "build the same house but faster" or "collect 20 wood with minimal tree cuts". This encourages skill refinement and looking for better algorithms or use of previously unused tools (maybe discover minecarts for transport, etc.).
* **Stage 6: Creative or Open-Ended Goals:** Finally, we allow the curriculum to propose more open goals like "build a bridge over a river" (the agent must figure out how big, materials, etc.), or "explore until you find something new (like a rare biome)". These tasks don't have a single correct solution and encourage the agent to really **improvise and combine** everything it has learned.

The curriculum is not strictly linear – if the agent struggles at one level, it can get intermediate tasks. Also, if an opportunity in the environment arises (say the agent stumbles on a cave with new minerals), the curriculum can adapt to take advantage ("now that you found a cave, try mining iron"). This adaptability can be achieved by conditioning the task generation on the world state and agent state, as Voyager did to tailor tasks to context (e.g., *"harvest sand and cactus before iron if in a desert"* to use their example).

**Gradual Increase in Difficulty:** We ensure that at each step, the task is just beyond the current mastery – this is the essence of curriculum learning. If tasks are too easy, the agent isn't learning; too hard, and it fails without learning. The LLM-based curriculum can be prompted to consider the agent's skill list and inventory to decide an appropriate challenge. For example, we might prompt: *"The agent knows: \[list skills]. It has: \[inventory]. Suggest a next goal that uses these skills in a new way or adds one new skill."* The output could be something like "The agent should learn to craft a stone pickaxe (it will need to mine stone and use the crafting table with wood and stone)". This seems feasible if it already can craft wood tools.

**Learning from Failures in Curriculum:** Not every proposed task will be achieved on first try. Failures are expected and are learning opportunities. If the agent fails a curriculum task, the system should analyze why. For instance, if "craft stone pickaxe" failed because the agent couldn't mine stone (maybe it needed a wooden pickaxe first), the curriculum module notices the missing prerequisite and generates a sub-task ("first, craft a wooden pickaxe"). This way, the curriculum can recursively decompose tasks the agent fails, providing the missing pieces. This is somewhat akin to *learning by failing forward*. We can use the LLM to analyze failure logs and explicitly ask "What prerequisite or simpler task should the agent do before this?"

**Human in the Loop (Optional):** While our goal is automatic curriculum generation, we can incorporate human feedback especially for safety-critical skills. A human overseer might review the list of proposed tasks or the agent's plan for a task and veto ones that seem risky ("maybe don't tell the agent to start a fire in a forest as a task"). The human might also inject tasks that impart human values or preferences (like "plant trees equal to the number you cut down"). This creates a kind of *alignment curriculum*. Over time, as trust in the agent grows, we can reduce human involvement.

**Assessment and Progression:** We will define **curriculum milestones** that mark when the agent is ready to move to more complex tasks. For example, only when the agent can reliably complete all basic resource and crafting tasks (milestone: "self-sufficient basic tool use") do we let it attempt advanced engineering projects. We can use the metrics from section 4 to determine this: e.g., 90% success on Stage 2 tasks might unlock Stage 3 tasks. The curriculum need not be strictly gated, but some notion of levels can prevent overwhelming the agent early on.

**Safety in Curriculum:** Importantly, the curriculum itself encodes safety by design. Early tasks might include *safe practice tasks* (like "build a small structure without altering any existing blocks" to teach constraint respect). We might initially restrict the agent's action set (for instance, not allow TNT or lava placement until it has shown responsibility in simpler tasks, or perhaps never allow if we want to avoid entirely). As the agent proves competence, more actions can become available. This *graduated unlocking of capabilities* ensures the agent doesn't do something catastrophic at the start. It mirrors how humans learn (you don't give a novice driver the fastest car on day one).

**Beyond SOTA – Curriculum Innovation:** Current systems like Voyager used an automatic curriculum mostly for exploration (e.g., maximizing new items). We can extend this by incorporating specific *skill benchmarks* – making sure the curriculum covers not just breadth (new items) but also depth (mastering certain complex activities thoroughly). Additionally, we could integrate **multi-agent scenarios** into the curriculum once a single-agent skills plateau: e.g., introduce a cooperative task (if another AI or a scripted agent is present) or an adversarial challenge to push the agent's strategy learning further. Another innovation is using the agent's own skill library to generate curriculum tasks – essentially *introspection-driven curriculum*: "Look at all the skills you have; can you think of something you *cannot* do yet that would be useful?" The LLM could generate a goal that addresses a gap (perhaps it notices there's no skill for farming crops, so it suggests learning farming). This self-driven goal generation would make the agent increasingly autonomous in seeking improvement, beyond following a preset syllabus.

Finally, we ensure **evaluation is part of the curriculum loop**: periodically, give the agent a mix of old and new tasks to check retention and adaptation. The curriculum is thus not just for learning but also for ongoing assessment, which feeds back into focusing on weak spots.

## 6. Innovations Beyond the Current State-of-the-Art

Bringing together the above elements, our neurosymbolic agent design already builds on cutting-edge work like Voyager, Code-as-Policy, and Toolformer. To push **beyond** the current state of the art, we propose several innovations and research directions:

* **Formal Verification and Guarantees:** Introduce lightweight formal methods to verify certain properties of generated code before execution. For example, we could use formal specifications for critical safety conditions (invariants like "do not break block type X") and employ a model checker or symbolic executor on the code. Ensuring an LLM's generated code adheres to formal specs would be a novel step towards provably safe autonomous agents.

* **Dynamic Tool Use and Knowledge Integration:** Going further than Toolformer, allow the agent to **call external knowledge bases or tools on the fly** when it faces something unknown. For instance, if the agent encounters a new item (say a "mysterious artifact"), it could query an online wiki or a trained knowledge model about it. Similarly, if complex computation is needed (pathfinding, scheduling), the agent can delegate to specialized algorithms via API. This makes the agent *extendable* – it's not limited to just the actions coded, but can augment its abilities by leveraging external APIs as tools. The challenge is to teach the LLM when to invoke these tools, which could be done with prompt engineering or fine-tuning using the Toolformer approach (injecting API call examples in training data).

* **Meta-Learning and Model Improvement:** While our agent primarily uses a fixed LLM (like GPT-4 via API in Voyager), an innovation would be to enable **on-the-fly model improvement** or fine-tuning. As the agent accumulates experience (state-action-result traces, code it wrote, self-critiques), we could periodically fine-tune a smaller local language model on this data. Over time, the agent develops its own specialized LLM that better understands its environment and prior skills (a form of *knowledge distillation* from GPT-4's outputs plus the agent's added insights). This moves towards greater autonomy from the foundation model and could improve efficiency (the agent's own model may handle routine reasoning, calling the big LLM only for very novel situations). Essentially, the agent would **learn to reason better** as it learns skills – a step toward an improving world model.

* **Automated Skill Compression and Abstraction:** As the skill library grows, we propose using techniques similar to program synthesis and library learning (like MIT's LILO or DreamCoder) to compress the library. The agent can discover common sub-patterns in skills and refactor them into new sub-skills (with the LLM's help). This leads to increasingly **abstract skills** that can solve whole classes of problems. For example, it might derive a generic "solve\_maze" skill if it notices similarities in how it navigates structures. By continually abstracting, the agent's knowledge becomes more *hierarchically organized* and compact, enabling leaps in solving harder tasks (because it has powerful primitives available). This is pushing beyond Voyager, which stored skills but did not attempt to abstract across them.

* **Enhanced Skill Selection via Planning:** We can augment the LLM's own decision-making with a traditional planner that operates on the skill library. Suppose the agent has 50 skills; a PDDL planner (or similar) could be given the preconditions/effects of each skill (learned or defined) and asked to find a sequence to achieve a novel goal. This hybrid approach could solve tasks that require longer sequences than the LLM can handle via one-shot prompting. It leverages symbolic search to navigate the large space of skill combinations efficiently. Integrating this with LLM (for goal interpretation and for filling in plan details) would advance the state-of-the-art in **LLM-planner integration**.

* **Safety and Ethics Layer:** Beyond technical safety, an innovative addition is an **ethical constraints module**. For instance, if the agent is in a multi-agent world with other players or creatures, we might encode rules of conduct (don't steal from others, don't needlessly harm animals in the game, etc.). The agent's LLM could be fine-tuned with these ethics, and an oversight process monitors compliance. While this may not apply to a single-player environment, it's forward-thinking for when such agents might interact in shared worlds or with humans. Ensuring "do no harm" in a broader sense could differentiate our agent as a **aligned, safe collaborator**.

* **Continual Learning with No Catastrophic Forgetting:** We already mitigate forgetting by storing skills, but we can push this further by ensuring the agent *revisits and practices* earlier skills occasionally (like spaced repetition). Also, if the environment itself updates (new game versions, new mechanics introduced), the agent should adapt without losing old competencies. Techniques from continual learning research (like memory systems or rehearsal of past tasks) could be incorporated so the agent remains robust over time. Voyager hinted at this by not fine-tuning the model (so it wouldn't forget) and using the skill library; we'd formally evaluate and guarantee it via our metrics and maybe theoretical analysis of library-based memory.

* **Multi-Agent Skill Exchange:** Going beyond a single agent, imagine multiple agents in different worlds sharing a global skill repository. An innovation could be a **federated skill learning**: each agent contributes skills it learned in its own world to a common library (with tagging of environment assumptions). Then, an agent faced with a challenge could see if another agent's skill can be transferred or adapted. For our single agent, we could simulate this by injecting some externally developed skills into its library (like a "seed" library of basic Minecraft knowledge from human-coded policies or another agent's run) to bootstrap it. This is speculative but could dramatically accelerate learning – akin to how humans share knowledge via language.

In conclusion, this design combines the strengths of neural and symbolic approaches: the **flexibility and knowledge** of LLMs with the **precision and safety** of symbolic code execution. By iteratively learning and refining skills, validating through rigorous testing, and structuring knowledge in a transparent way, the agent will continuously self-improve. The innovations proposed – from on-the-fly tool use and formal validation to skill abstraction and planner integration – aim to make the agent not just match but exceed current state-of-the-art capabilities. Ultimately, our goal is an embodied agent that **learns cumulatively and safely**, able to handle increasingly complex tasks in an open-ended voxel world, while providing interpretable, verifiable outputs at each step. This would be a significant step beyond current systems that, for all their progress, still have limitations in long-term autonomy and safety. The fusion of techniques we propose could serve as a blueprint for the next generation of lifelong learning, neurosymbolic AI agents.
