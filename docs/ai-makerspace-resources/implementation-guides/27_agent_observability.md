# Agent Observability - Luanti Implementation Guide

# Implementation Guide for Integrating Agent Observability into Luanti Voyager

## Executive Summary

Agent Observability is an advanced AI technique designed to enhance the decision-making capabilities of AI agents in games by enabling them to perceive and understand their environment more comprehensively. In the context of Luanti Voyager, integrating this system will allow AI agents to make more intelligent decisions, leading to a richer gameplay experience for players. This feature is valuable because it enhances the realism and adaptability of AI behavior, making interactions with non-player characters (NPCs) more engaging and challenging. While introducing Agent Observability can have performance implications due to increased computational load, careful design and optimization strategies will ensure minimal impact on game performance.

## Core Architecture

### System Design Components
1. **AgentObservabilitySystem**: Manages the overall observability process.
2. **SensorManager**: Collects data from various sensors in the game environment (e.g., position, nearby objects).
3. **DataProcessor**: Processes raw sensor data into meaningful information.
4. **DecisionMaker**: Uses processed data to make decisions for AI agents.

### Data Flow Diagram
1. **Sensors** collect data about the environment.
2. **SensorManager** gathers and stores this data.
3. **DataProcessor** transforms raw data into actionable insights.
4. **DecisionMaker** uses these insights to guide agent behavior.
5. **AgentObservabilitySystem** integrates all components, ensuring seamless communication.

### Integration Points with Game Engine
- **Environment Data**: Gathered from Luanti Voyager's game world.
- **AI Agent Logic**: Integrated within the AI decision-making framework of the game.
- **Event System**: Hooks into existing events to trigger observability processes.

    def __init__(self):
        self.data = []

    async def collect_data(self, agent_position: np.ndarray, world_state: Dict[str, Any]):
        # Simulate data collection from sensors
        sensor_data = {
            "position": agent_position,
            "nearby_objects": [
                {"type": obj["type"], "distance": np.linalg.norm(agent_position - np.array(obj["position"]))}
                for obj in world_state["objects"]
            ]
        }

        return SensorData(**sensor_data)


class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def process(self, sensor_data: SensorData) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Process sensor data to extract meaningful information
        processed_data = {
            "position": sensor_data.position,
            "nearest_object": min(sensor_data.nearby_objects, key=lambda x: x["distance"])
        }
        return processed_data


class DecisionMaker:
    def __init__(self):

        nearest_object = processed_data["nearest_object"]
        if nearest_object["type"] == "resource":
            return "move_to_resource"
        elif nearest_object["type"] == "enemy":
            return "attack_enemy"
        else:
            return "idle"


class AgentObservabilitySystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sensor_manager = SensorManager()
        self.data_processor = DataProcessor()
        self.decision_maker = DecisionMaker()

    async def process(self, agent_position: np.ndarray, world_state: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        sensor_data = await self.sensor_manager.collect_data(agent_position, world_state)
        processed_data = self.data_processor.process(sensor_data)
        decision = self.decision_maker.decide(processed_data)

# Example usage
async def main():
    agent_position = np.array([0, 0, 0])
    world_state = {
        "objects": [
            {"type": "resource", "position": [1, 1, 1]},
            {"type": "enemy", "position": [-1, -1, -1]}
        ]
    }

    aos = AgentObservabilitySystem()

```

### Error Handling and Edge Cases
- **Sensor Data Collection**: Handle cases where no data is collected.
- **Data Processing**: Ensure processed data does not contain invalid entries.
- **Decision Making**: Implement fallback decisions for unexpected states.

### Configuration Options
- **Sensors**: Define which sensors to use (e.g., position, nearby objects).
- **Processing**: Configure processing parameters (e.g., distance threshold).
- **Decisions**: Customize decision-making rules based on game context.

## Game-Specific Optimizations

### Tick Rate Considerations
- Adjust observability processing frequency based on the game's tick rate to balance performance and responsiveness.
  
### Memory Management
- Use efficient data structures to minimize memory usage.
- Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.

### Multiplayer Synchronization
- Ensure that observability data is synchronized across clients in multiplayer scenarios.
- Use reliable communication channels (e.g., WebSockets) for real-time data exchange.

## Agent Behavior Examples

### Example 1: Resource Gathering
**Before**: AI agent moves randomly without recognizing resources.
**After**: AI agent identifies and moves towards nearest resource.

### Example 2: Enemy Detection
**Before**: AI agent does not detect enemies until they are very close.
**After**: AI agent detects enemy presence early and takes defensive actions.

### Example 3: Terrain Navigation
**Before**: AI agent gets stuck on obstacles without recognizing them.
**After**: AI agent navigates around obstacles using sensor data.

### Example 4: Team Coordination
**Before**: Individual AI agents act independently without coordination.
**After**: AI agents coordinate with teammates to achieve shared objectives.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests for Core Components
- Test `SensorManager` for accurate data collection.
- Validate `DataProcessor` transformations.
- Ensure `DecisionMaker` makes correct decisions based on processed data.

### Integration Tests with Game Engine
- Simulate game scenarios to verify observability system integration.
- Check that AI agent behavior aligns with expected outcomes.

### Performance Benchmarks
- Measure processing time and memory usage under different loads.
- Optimize critical paths for improved performance.

## Deployment Checklist

### Configuration Steps
1. Configure sensors and processing parameters in `AgentObservabilitySystem`.
2. Integrate observability system with game AI logic.

### Monitoring Setup
- Use logging to monitor system performance.
- Implement alerts for critical issues (e.g., data processing failures).

### Rollback Procedures
- Maintain backups of previous system configurations.
- Develop rollback plans in case of deployment issues.

## Advanced Patterns

### Scaling to Many Agents
- Distribute observability processing across multiple threads or processes.
- Use distributed computing frameworks (e.g., Apache Kafka) for large-scale deployments.

### Player Interaction Patterns
- Design AI agents to adapt based on player behavior.
- Implement feedback loops to refine agent decision-making over time.

### Emergent Behaviors
- Encourage emergent behaviors by allowing agents to learn from their interactions.
- Provide tools for developers to analyze and optimize agent learning processes.

This comprehensive guide provides a robust framework for integrating Agent Observability into Luanti Voyager, ensuring that AI agents are well-equipped to enhance player experiences through intelligent behavior.
