# Implementation Guide for Luanti Voyager

## Executive Summary

The integration of **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** protocols from AI Makerspace will significantly enhance the AI capabilities within Luanti Voyager. MCP facilitates the exposure of game actions as tools that can be dynamically registered, discovered, and executed by agents, while A2A enables sophisticated multi-agent communication and coordination. This combination allows for real-time, intelligent decision-making and collaboration among various AI entities in the game environment.

## Core Architecture

### Adaptation to Game Environment
- **MCP Server/Client**: The MCP server will act as a central hub for tool registration and execution. Clients (game actions) can register with this server, making them accessible to agents.
- **A2A Communication**: Agents within Luanti Voyager will communicate with each other using standardized protocols defined by A2A. This includes message passing, event-driven communication, and shared state management.
- **Orchestration Layer**: An orchestrator agent will manage and coordinate the actions of multiple AI entities, ensuring they work together seamlessly towards common goals.

## MCP Integration

### Exposing Game Actions as MCP Tools
1. **Tool Registration**:
   - Each game action (e.g., mining, building, crafting) is encapsulated as an MCP tool.
   - These tools register with the MCP server using a standardized API.
2. **Tool Discovery**:
   - Agents can discover available tools via queries to the MCP server.
3. **Tool Execution**:
   - Upon discovery, agents can invoke these tools by sending requests to the MCP server.
   - The server executes the tool and returns results back to the requesting agent.

### Example: Dice Roller
- **dice_roller.py**: A simple example where a dice roller is exposed as an MCP tool. Agents can request this tool to make random decisions or simulations within the game.

## A2A Implementation

### Agent Communication in Multiplayer Context
1. **Agent Types**:
   - Different types of agents (e.g., travel_agent, planner_agent) are created based on their roles within the game.
2. **Communication Protocols**:
   - Agents communicate using well-defined message formats and protocols.
   - Messages can include action requests, status updates, and event notifications.
3. **Workflow Management**:
   - The orchestrator agent manages workflows by coordinating tasks among agents.

### Example: Orchestrator Agent
- **orchestrator_agent.py**: Manages the lifecycle of other agents, assigns tasks, and handles synchronization.

## Orchestration Pattern

### Managing Multiple AI Agents in the Game
1. **Task Assignment**:
   - The orchestrator assigns specific tasks to different agents based on their capabilities.
2. **Synchronization**:
   - Ensures that all agents are synchronized and working towards a common goal.
3. **Resource Management**:
   - Coordinates resource allocation among agents to avoid conflicts.

### Workflow Example
- **Collaborative Building**: Multiple agents (e.g., miners, builders) work together to construct buildings using resources collected from the environment.

## Tool Registry

### Game-Specific Tools (Mining, Building, Crafting)
1. **Tool Definition**:
   - Define tools for specific game actions with clear interfaces and parameters.
2. **Dynamic Registration**:
   - Tools can be dynamically added or removed based on game state changes.
3. **Versioning**:
   - Support versioned tool interfaces to ensure compatibility across different agents.

### Example Tool: Mining
- **mining_tool.py**: Implements the mining action, registers with MCP server, and handles requests from agents.

## Communication Flow

### Real-Time Agent Coordination
1. **Push Notifications**:
   - Agents receive real-time updates about events in the game world via push notifications.
2. **Message Passing**:
   - Agents use message passing to share information, request actions, or report status.
3. **State Synchronization**:
   - Ensures that all agents have an up-to-date view of the game state.

## Performance Considerations

### Scaling to Many Agents
1. **Scalability**:
   - Design systems to handle increasing numbers of agents without degradation in performance.
2. **Load Balancing**:
   - Distribute tasks across multiple servers or instances to optimize resource utilization.
3. **Efficient Communication**:
   - Use efficient communication protocols and data formats to minimize network overhead.

## Security & Permissions

### Controlling Agent Capabilities
1. **Access Control**:
   - Define permissions for different types of agents based on their roles.
2. **Authentication**:
   - Implement authentication mechanisms to ensure only authorized agents can access tools or communicate with other agents.
3. **Audit Trails**:
   - Maintain logs of agent actions and communications for auditing purposes.

### Security Example
- **Access Control List (ACL)**: Defines permissions for mining_tool.py, allowing only certain agents to use it.

## Example Scenarios

### Village AI
1. **Scenario Description**:
   - A village with multiple agents responsible for resource gathering, construction, and defense.
2. **Implementation Details**:
   - Agents communicate using A2A protocols to coordinate tasks such as mining, building houses, and defending against attacks.

### Collaborative Building
1. **Scenario Description**:
   - Multiple players collaborate with AI agents to construct a large structure in the game world.
2. **Implementation Details**:
   - Orchestrator agent coordinates actions among human and AI players to ensure efficient resource use and construction progress.

## Conclusion

The integration of MCP and A2A protocols into Luanti Voyager will enable advanced AI capabilities, enhancing gameplay dynamics through intelligent, coordinated decision-making among various entities. By leveraging these technologies, developers can create rich, interactive experiences that adapt and evolve based on player actions and interactions with the game world.

### Next Steps
- **Prototype Development**: Develop prototypes to test MCP and A2A integrations within Luanti Voyager.
