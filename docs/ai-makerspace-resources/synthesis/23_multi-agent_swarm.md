# Implementation Guide: Multi-Agent Swarm for Luanti Voyager

## Executive Summary

This implementation guide provides a comprehensive approach to integrating Multi-Agent Swarm (MAS) technology into Luanti Voyager, an open-source Minecraft-like game. MAS enables AI agents to coordinate, communicate, and work together to achieve collective goals, such as village simulation with specialized roles, collaborative building projects, resource gathering teams, and defense formations. For players, this enhancement leads to more dynamic and engaging gameplay experiences, where the environment is responsive and intelligent. Performance implications are carefully considered throughout the implementation, ensuring that the system remains efficient even with numerous agents.

## Core Architecture

### System Design
The Multi-Agent Swarm System (MASS) consists of several key components:
- **Agent Manager**: Manages the creation, updating, and destruction of agents.
- **Communication Module**: Handles message passing between agents for coordination and information sharing.
- **Task Allocator**: Assigns tasks to agents based on their roles and current needs.
- **Behavior Engine**: Executes predefined behaviors based on agent roles and environmental inputs.

### Data Flow Diagram
1. **Initialization**: The Agent Manager initializes a set of agents with specific roles.
2. **Communication**: Agents send messages to each other through the Communication Module to share information about their state and environment.
3. **Task Assignment**: The Task Allocator receives input from the Environment or directly from agents, assigns tasks based on priority and agent capabilities, and sends these tasks back to the agents.
4. **Behavior Execution**: Each agent executes its assigned task using behaviors defined in the Behavior Engine.

### Integration Points with Game Engine
- **Environment Data**: Agents receive updates about their environment (e.g., resources available, threats) from the game engine.
- **Action Execution**: Agent actions (e.g., mining, building) are executed by the game engine based on instructions from the MAS system.
- **Synchronization**: Ensures that all agents' states and actions are synchronized with the game world.

# Multi-Agent Swarm Implementation for Luanti Voyager
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass
import asyncio
import json


@dataclass
class Agent:
    id: int
    role: str
    position: np.ndarray
    state: str = "idle"
    task_queue: List[str] = None

    def __post_init__(self):
        self.task_queue = []

    def receive_message(self, message: Dict[str, Any]):
        if message["type"] == "task":
            self.task_queue.append(message["content"])

    def execute_task(self):
        if self.task_queue:
            task = self.task_queue.pop(0)
            print(f"Agent {self.id} is executing task: {task}")
            self.state = "busy"
            # Simulate task execution
            asyncio.sleep(1)
            self.state = "idle"

    def send_message(self, receiver_id: int, message: Dict[str, Any]):
        CommunicationModule.send_message(receiver_id, message)


class AgentManager:
    agents: List[Agent]

    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = []

    def create_agent(self, role: str) -> Agent:
        agent_id = len(self.agents)
        new_agent = Agent(id=agent_id, role=role, position=np.random.rand(3))
        self.agents.append(new_agent)
        return new_agent

    def update_agents(self):
        for agent in self.agents:
            if agent.state == "idle":
                TaskAllocator.assign_task(agent)


class CommunicationModule:
    message_queue: Dict[int, List[Dict[str, Any]]]

    def __init__(self):
        self.message_queue = {}

    @staticmethod
    def send_message(receiver_id: int, message: Dict[str, Any]):
        if receiver_id not in CommunicationModule.message_queue:
            CommunicationModule.message_queue[receiver_id] = []
        CommunicationModule.message_queue[receiver_id].append(message)

    @staticmethod
    def receive_messages(agent_id: int) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        messages = CommunicationModule.message_queue.get(agent_id, [])
        CommunicationModule.message_queue[agent_id] = []
        return messages


class TaskAllocator:
    tasks: Dict[str, Any]

    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = {}

    @staticmethod
    def assign_task(agent: Agent):
        task = {"type": "gather", "content": "wood"}
        agent.send_message(agent.id, task)


# Initialize components
agent_manager = AgentManager()
communication_module = CommunicationModule()
task_allocator = TaskAllocator()

# Create agents
for _ in range(5):
    agent_manager.create_agent(role="builder")

# Simulate agent updates and task execution
async def main():
    while True:
        for agent in agent_manager.agents:
            messages = communication_module.receive_messages(agent.id)
            for message in messages:
                agent.receive_message(message)
            if agent.state == "idle":
                agent.execute_task()
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)

# Run the simulation
asyncio.run(main())
```

### Error Handling and Edge Cases
- **Message Loss**: Implement retries or acknowledgment mechanisms to handle lost messages.
- **Task Conflicts**: Ensure that task assignments do not conflict with each other.
- **Agent Failures**: Allow for agent recovery or replacement in case of failure.

### Configuration Options
- **Number of Agents**: Configure the number of agents initialized by the Agent Manager.
- **Communication Protocol**: Choose between different communication protocols (e.g., direct messaging, broadcasting).
- **Task Prioritization**: Define task prioritization rules within Task Allocator.

## Game-Specific Optimizations

### Tick Rate Considerations
- Synchronize agent updates with the game engine's tick rate to ensure smooth execution.
- Use event-driven updates for agents that are idle or waiting for tasks to improve performance.

### Memory Management
- Efficiently manage memory usage by reusing objects and cleaning up unused references.
- Implement garbage collection mechanisms for agents that are no longer needed.

### Multiplayer Synchronization
- Ensure that agent states and actions are synchronized across all players in a multiplayer setting.
- Use reliable data transmission protocols to prevent inconsistencies.

## Agent Behavior Examples

### Village Simulation with Specialized Roles
**Before**: Agents perform random actions, leading to disorganized village development.
**After**: Agents with specialized roles (e.g., builders, farmers) work together to build and maintain the village efficiently.

### Collaborative Building Projects
**Before**: Agents build structures independently, leading to inefficient use of resources.
**After**: Agents coordinate to build complex structures collaboratively, reducing resource waste and improving construction speed.

### Resource Gathering Teams
**Before**: Agents gather resources randomly, leading to inefficient collection and hoarding.
**After**: Agents form teams with specialized roles (e.g., miners, collectors) to gather and distribute resources efficiently.

### Defense Formations
**Before**: Agents defend the village individually, making it vulnerable to attacks.
**After**: Agents coordinate in defense formations to provide a robust defense against threats.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests for Core Components
- Test individual components such as Agent Manager, Communication Module, Task Allocator, and Behavior Engine in isolation.

### Integration Tests with Game Engine
- Integrate the MAS system with Luanti Voyager's game engine and perform tests to ensure seamless interaction.
- Verify that agents receive correct information from the environment and execute tasks accurately.

### Performance Benchmarks
- Measure the performance of the MAS system under different conditions (e.g., varying numbers of agents, complex tasks).
- Optimize code for better performance based on benchmark results.

## Deployment Checklist

### Configuration Steps
1. Install necessary dependencies.
2. Configure the number of agents and other parameters in the configuration file.
3. Initialize the Agent Manager, Communication Module, and Task Allocator.

### Monitoring Setup
- Set up logging mechanisms to monitor agent activities and system performance.
- Use monitoring tools to track resource usage and identify potential bottlenecks.

### Rollback Procedures
- Document rollback procedures in case of deployment failures or unexpected behavior.
- Create backup configurations and code snapshots before deploying new versions.

## Advanced Patterns

### Scaling to Many Agents
- Implement efficient data structures and algorithms to handle large numbers of agents.
- Use distributed computing techniques to scale the MAS system across multiple servers.

### Player Interaction Patterns
- Allow players to interact with and influence AI agents (e.g., assigning tasks, providing resources).
- Design user interfaces for player interaction that are intuitive and easy to use.

### Emergent Behaviors
- Encourage emergent behaviors by allowing agents to adapt their actions based on environmental inputs.
- Monitor and analyze emergent patterns to improve the MAS system over time.
