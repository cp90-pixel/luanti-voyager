# üéØ Luanti Voyager Strategic Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Learning Infrastructure (Next 2-4 weeks)

### 1.1 Skill Execution Framework ‚≠ê PRIORITY
**Goal:** Enable agents to write and execute their own code

**Components:**
- **Code Generation Pipeline**
  - LLM ‚Üí Code (Lua for Luanti, Python for logic)
  - Syntax validation and safety checks
  - Sandboxed execution environment
  - Error handling and retry logic

- **Skill Library Management**
  - Version control (git-like for skills)
  - Dependency tracking
  - Skill composition (combine simple skills)
  - Success metrics and optimization

**Technical Approach:**
```python
# Example skill generation
skill_code = llm.generate_skill(
    goal="Build a 3x3x3 wooden house",
    available_actions=["place_block", "move_to"],
    constraints=["must have door", "must have roof"]
)
skill = SkillExecutor.compile_and_validate(skill_code)
result = await skill.execute(agent, world_state)
```

### 1.2 Fix Terrain Generation üåç
**Goal:** Get actual blocks to work with

**Approaches:**
1. **Import existing worlds** - Quick fix, use community worlds
2. **Custom terrain generator** - Build our own simple terrain
3. **Game compatibility** - Find game that works with current setup

### 1.3 Curriculum Learning System üìö
**Goal:** Structured skill progression

**Design:**
```yaml
curriculum:
  beginner:
    - find_wood: "Locate and approach tree"
    - collect_wood: "Mine tree blocks"
    - craft_planks: "Convert logs to planks"
  
  intermediate:
    - build_shelter: "Create basic structure"
    - manage_resources: "Organize inventory"
    - navigate_terrain: "Handle obstacles"
    
  advanced:
    - automate_tasks: "Create helper functions"
    - optimize_paths: "Efficient movement"
    - complex_building: "Multi-room structures"
```

## Phase 2: Advanced Capabilities (Weeks 4-8)

### 2.1 Vision-Language Integration üëÅÔ∏è
**Goal:** Rich visual understanding

**Components:**
- Scene graph generation
- Pattern recognition
- Visual memory system
- Structure understanding

### 2.2 Multi-Agent Coordination ü§ù
**Goal:** Agents that work together

**Features:**
- Shared world model
- Task allocation
- Communication protocols
- Conflict resolution

### 2.3 Compositional Skills üß©
**Goal:** Build complex from simple

**Example:**
```
base_skills = ["move", "place_block", "mine_block"]
‚Üí compound_skill = "build_wall"
‚Üí complex_skill = "build_house" 
‚Üí advanced_skill = "build_village"
```

## Phase 3: Research Frontiers (Months 2-3)

### 3.1 Self-Improving Agents üß†
- Meta-learning (learning to learn)
- Automatic curriculum generation
- Self-supervised skill discovery

### 3.2 Emergent Communication üí¨
- Agents develop their own language
- Efficient information transfer
- Cultural evolution of strategies

### 3.3 Open-Ended Learning üåü
- No predefined goals
- Intrinsic motivation
- Creativity metrics

## Technical Recommendations

### Architecture Principles
1. **Modularity First**
   - Pluggable components
   - Clear interfaces
   - Easy to extend

2. **Scalability by Design**
   - Distributed from start
   - Async everything
   - Resource limits

3. **Observability Built-in**
   - Metrics for everything
   - Visual debugging tools
   - Replay capabilities

### Key Design Decisions

#### Skill Representation
```python
@skill("build_wooden_wall")
@requires(["place_block", "have_wood"])
@provides(["wall_structure"])
async def build_wooden_wall(agent, start_pos, end_pos):
    """LLM-generated skill with metadata"""
    # Generated code here
    pass
```

#### Memory Architecture
- **Short-term**: Current task context (Redis-like)
- **Long-term**: Learned skills and strategies (SQLite)
- **Episodic**: Specific experiences (Vector DB)
- **Semantic**: Concept relationships (Graph DB)

#### Learning Pipeline
```
Experience ‚Üí Reflection ‚Üí Abstraction ‚Üí Skill Generation ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Integration
```
