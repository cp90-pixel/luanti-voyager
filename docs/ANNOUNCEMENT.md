# üöÄ Let's Teach AI to Dream in Blocks!

Hey everyone! We're starting something wild and we want you to be part of it.

## What if AI could truly explore?

Remember when you first played Minecraft and didn't know what to do? You punched trees, built weird houses, and probably died to a creeper. Now imagine an AI having that same experience - learning, failing, discovering, and eventually mastering the world in ways we never expected.

That's **Luanti Voyager** - an open playground for AI agents in the Luanti (formerly Minetest) voxel world.

## Why This is Different

üîì **Actually Open Source** - No corporate strings, no licensing headaches, just pure creative freedom

‚ö° **Blazing Fast** - Thanks to Craftium, we can run thousands of actions per second

üß™ **Anything Goes** - Use any LLM, any approach, any wild idea you have

ü§ù **Community First** - This isn't our project, it's whatever we build together

## The Dream

Imagine agents that:
- Learn to survive from scratch
- Build incredible structures
- Discover game mechanics we didn't know existed
- Work together on massive projects
- Create their own challenges
- Maybe even modify the game itself

We honestly don't know what's possible. That's what makes this exciting!

## Join the Experiment

### For Makers
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/toddllm/luanti-voyager.git
cd luanti-voyager
# Make something amazing
```

That's it. No complex setup, no permission needed. Just dive in.

### For Dreamers
- Share wild ideas in Discussions
- Sketch out agent behaviors you'd love to see
- Imagine new types of challenges
- Ask "what if..." questions

### For Breakers
- Try to confuse the agents
- Find weird edge cases
- Build impossible scenarios
- Push every limit

### For Everyone
- Star the repo if you're curious
- Share with friends who like weird AI stuff
- Join the Matrix chat: `#luanti-voyager:matrix.org`
- Post your agent doing something cool

## What's Next?

Honestly? We don't know, and that's the point. Maybe we'll have agents that:
- Speedrun the game
- Create art galleries
- Develop their own languages
- Build functioning computers
- Tell stories about their adventures
- Something nobody's thought of yet

## No Roadmap, Just Exploration

We have some rough phases in mind:
1. **Make it work** (agents that don't immediately die)
2. **Make it smart** (agents that actually learn)
3. **Make it amazing** (agents that blow our minds)
4. **Make it impossible** (agents that transcend the game)

But really, work on whatever excites you. Skip to the end if you want!

## Standing on Giant Shoulders

Huge thanks to:
- [Voyager](https://github.com/MineDojo/Voyager) for proving this could work
- [Craftium](https://github.com/mikelma/craftium) for making it fast
- [Luanti](https://github.com/luanti/luanti) for being truly open
- You, for being here at the beginning

## The Fine Print

MIT License. Do literally whatever you want.
