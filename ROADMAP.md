# The Journey Ahead

## 🎯 Where We Want to Go

Build the wildest, most creative AI agent playground for voxel worlds. No limits, just exploration and discovery.

## 🗺️ The Adventure Map

### 🌱 Phase 1: Plant the Seeds
**Get something working that makes us smile**

- [ ] Basic agent that explores without immediately dying
- [ ] Simple way to see what the agent sees
- [ ] First successful tree punch (a rite of passage!)
- [ ] Save and share the first learned skill
- [ ] Someone says "hey, this actually works!"

**You'll know we're ready when:** People start forking and trying their own ideas

### 🌿 Phase 2: Watch It Grow
**Make the agents actually smart**

- [ ] Agents that learn from mistakes
- [ ] Skills that combine into bigger skills
- [ ] Different LLM brains working together
- [ ] Agents teaching each other
- [ ] The first "I can't believe it figured that out" moment

**You'll know we're ready when:** Agents surprise us daily

### 🌳 Phase 3: Build the Forest
**Create an ecosystem**

- [ ] Agents working together on big projects
- [ ] Community skill marketplace
- [ ] Weird experiments we never imagined
- [ ] Agents modifying their own world
- [ ] Research papers citing our work

**You'll know we're ready when:** The community is driving innovation

### 🌟 Phase 4: Reach for the Stars
**Push every boundary**

- [ ] Things we literally can't imagine yet
- [ ] Agents creating new game modes
- [ ] Cross-world agent migration
- [ ] AI societies with emergent behaviors
- [ ] Someone builds something that changes everything

**You'll know we're ready when:** We're all just watching in awe

## 💡 Wild Ideas Welcome

This roadmap is just a starting point. Got a crazy idea? Jump straight to it! Want to work on Phase 4 stuff right now? Go for it!

Some random ideas to spark imagination:
- Agents that dream and plan while idle
- Evolution-based skill development
- Agents that make art
- Competitive agent battles
- Agents that tell stories about their adventures
- Cross-game knowledge transfer
- Agents that develop their own languages
- Whatever wild thing you're thinking right now

## 🎮 Success Looks Like...

- **Fun**: People are excited to see what their agents do next
- **Surprising**: Regular "whoa" moments in the community
- **Accessible**: Anyone can spin up an agent in minutes
- **Creative**: New approaches emerging weekly
- **Collaborative**: Skills and ideas flowing freely

## 🚧 Challenges We'll Face (And Overcome!)

- **Performance**: Making it fast enough to be fun
- **Simplicity**: Keeping it easy while adding features
- **Diversity**: Supporting many different approaches
- **Community**: Growing while staying welcoming
- **Resources**: Doing amazing things on a shoestring

But hey, challenges make it interesting!

## 🤝 How to Shape the Future

1. **Pick any checkbox** and make it happen
2. **Add your own checkboxes** for things we missed
3. **Skip ahead** to whatever excites you most
4. **Change direction** if you see a better path
5. **Break things** and tell us what you learned

## 📈 Measuring Magic

Forget traditional metrics. We'll know we're succeeding when:

- Pull requests come from unexpected places
- Someone builds something we never imagined
- Agents develop strategies we have to study to understand
- The community teaches us more than we teach them
- People are having fun

## 🎉 Celebration Moments

We'll party when:
- First agent survives a full day/night cycle
- First community-contributed skill
- First agent-discovered exploit
- First cross-agent collaboration
- First "this changes everything" moment
