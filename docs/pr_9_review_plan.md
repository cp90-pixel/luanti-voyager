# PR #9 Review Plan: Adaptive Learning System

**PR Details:**
- **Title:** Feature/issue#6 - Adaptive Learning System for Agent Improvement
- **Author:** cp90-pixel (external contributor)
- **Scale:** 3,241 lines added, 0 deleted (15 new files)
- **Features:** Adaptive Learning System + Community Challenge Framework
- **Status:** Open, awaiting review

## Overview

This PR introduces a comprehensive adaptive learning system that enables agents to learn from experiences, adapt strategies, and improve performance over time. The implementation includes failure analysis, success optimization, adaptive behavior mechanisms, AND a separate community challenge framework.

**‚ö†Ô∏è SCOPE CONCERN:** This PR combines two distinct feature sets (~3.2k LOC). Consider requesting split into separate PRs for incremental review.

## Review Objectives

1. **Security Assessment** - Ensure no vulnerabilities or malicious code
2. **Architecture Compatibility** - Verify integration with existing codebase  
3. **Code Quality** - Review implementation standards and best practices
4. **Functionality Testing** - Validate the learning algorithms work as intended
5. **Performance Impact** - Assess computational overhead and resource usage
6. **Documentation Review** - Evaluate completeness and clarity

## BLOCKING REQUIREMENTS (Must Complete Before Review)

### üö´ Request Changes Immediately For:
1. **Missing Tests**: No unit/integration tests provided - MUST add `pytest` tests with ‚â•80% coverage
2. **Security Hardening**: File I/O needs path sanitization and JSON schema validation  
3. **PR Scope**: Consider splitting into two PRs (learning system vs challenge framework)
4. **CI Integration**: Tests must be wired into CI pipeline
5. **License Compliance**: Missing license headers (project uses LGPL)

## Automated Pre-Review Checklist

**Run these automated checks BEFORE manual review:**

```bash
# Code quality gates (must pass)
flake8 luanti_voyager/challenge_system/ examples/adaptive_learning_demo.py examples/challenge_workflow.py
mypy luanti_voyager/challenge_system/
black --check luanti_voyager/challenge_system/

# Security scanning (must pass)
bandit -r luanti_voyager/challenge_system/ examples/
safety check

# Test coverage (must be ‚â•80%)
pytest --cov=luanti_voyager.challenge_system --cov-fail-under=80 tests/

# License compliance check
reuse lint || echo "License headers missing"
```

**‚ùå FAIL GATES:** If any automated check fails, request changes immediately.
