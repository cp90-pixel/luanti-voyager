## Introduction

Autonomous agents operating in complex environments need a way to accumulate and organize knowledge about their world. Instead of relying on fixed, pre-programmed facts, these agents should **learn from experience** – observing their surroundings and outcomes of their actions – and update an internal knowledge graph continuously. A knowledge graph provides a structured **memory** that can be queried for reasoning and planning, much like a human's mental map of the world. This graph-based memory must be **evolving** (adapting as the world or agent's understanding changes), and rich enough to capture diverse aspects of knowledge: from where things are, to how events unfold, to what each object can be used for, and even the behaviors of other agents. Building such a system involves addressing challenges in knowledge representation, learning, and multi-agent cooperation. In this report, we outline the key knowledge elements to capture, discuss major challenges and research questions, and propose design considerations for agents to build and maintain evolving knowledge graphs.

## Knowledge Graph Requirements

An agent's knowledge graph should encode multiple **dimensions of knowledge** about the world. The following are critical types of information the graph must capture, along with their meanings:

* **Spatial Relationships (What is where):** The graph should represent the physical configuration of the environment, including locations of objects and their spatial relations. For example, a robot's knowledge graph might have nodes for rooms or landmarks and edges denoting adjacency or containment (e.g. *Kitchen* is adjacent to *LivingRoom*, *Mug* is on *Table*). Spatial knowledge also includes part-whole relationships (e.g. a *shirt* has parts *left sleeve* and *right sleeve*) and layouts that the agent must detect in its environment. By mapping out "what is where," the agent can navigate and manipulate objects more effectively.

* **Causal Relationships (What causes what):** The graph must encode cause-and-effect links between events and states. Causal knowledge conveys how the agent's actions or other events lead to changes in the world. For instance, an edge might represent that *pressing switch → turns on light*, or that *spilling water → causes floor wet*. Causal edges allow the agent to predict outcomes of actions and reason about how to achieve goals (by selecting actions that cause desired effects). This type of knowledge may be learned by observing state transitions and outcomes over time.

* **Temporal Patterns (When things happen):** The knowledge graph should track temporal information – sequences of events and time-based patterns. This includes ordering of actions (e.g. *unlock door* should occur **before** *open door*) and periodic or contextual timing (certain events happen at specific times). A **Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG)** explicitly represents when relationships start, change, or end. For example, an agent might record a fact like (*sprinklers ON*, *during*, *6:00–6:10 AM*) to capture a recurring temporal pattern. Temporal annotations enable the agent to answer questions like "What was true at time *t*?" and to recognize trends or anticipate future events.

* **Affordances (What can be done with objects):** Affordances describe the possible actions or uses an object affords to an agent. The knowledge graph should link **objects to the actions** that the agent (or others) can perform with them. For example, a node for *door* might connect to *open* (action) if the door can be opened, or *key* might afford *unlocking* a lock. Capturing affordances involves storing functional relationships: e.g., (*cup*, *affords*, *drinking*), (*chair*, *affords*, *sitting*). These relationships help the agent understand how to use tools and objects in its environment to accomplish tasks. In essence, affordances encode the action possibilities offered by objects in context.

* **Social Knowledge (Other agents' behaviors and states):** In multi-agent environments, an agent's knowledge graph should also include information about other agents. This can range from simple relationships (like *AgentA* is a teammate of *AgentB*) to more complex attributions such as beliefs, goals, or typical behavior patterns of others. An agent may maintain **beliefs about other agents' beliefs or intentions**, a form of higher-order knowledge. For example, an edge could represent that *AgentB believes X*, allowing our agent to predict Agent B's actions. Social knowledge might also include norms or roles (e.g. *AgentC* is leader of *Group1*). By modeling others in the graph, the agent can coordinate and strategize in social or cooperative tasks (for instance, knowing that if *AgentB* usually patrols Area1 at night, our agent can plan around that). Representing other agents as nodes with attributes (preferences, trustworthiness, etc.) or as sub-graphs of their observed state can enable a form of **Theory of Mind** within the knowledge graph.

These knowledge types do not exist in isolation – they interact. For instance, understanding an event like a **human demonstration** involves spatial, temporal, and causal knowledge combined. A comprehensive world model graph will integrate all five aspects so the agent can reason holistically about "what is happening, where, when, why, and who/what is involved."

## Key Challenges

Designing a system for agents to build and maintain such evolving knowledge graphs presents several **key challenges**:

* **Learning from Unstructured Experience:** The agent must **learn knowledge from raw experience** (sensors, observations, interactions) rather than rely on pre-programmed facts. This is non-trivial because real-world inputs are unstructured (images, audio, free-form text, continuous sensor streams). The challenge is how to extract structured knowledge graph entries (entities, relations) from these messy experiences. Recent approaches propose pipelines that parse raw inputs into events and relationships. For example, an agent might have an *Input Parser* to convert a camera image or a text log into observations, and an *Entity & Relation Extractor* to identify objects and relations which are then added as nodes and edges in the graph. Nonetheless, reliably going from pixels or text to accurate knowledge triples is hard; it may involve computer vision for spatial relations, natural language understanding for textual descriptions, and even trial-and-error interactions to infer causal links. The agent needs to **generalize** from specific experiences to broader knowledge (e.g. learning that "cups can hold liquids" from one spilled cup incident). Ensuring this learning happens incrementally and autonomously, without human labeling, is a major research challenge.

* **Uncertainty and Belief Revision:** Agents operate with **partial and noisy observations**, so the knowledge graph must handle uncertainty and be open to revision. New evidence might contradict what the agent previously believed (for instance, the agent's graph thought an object was at location X, but a new sensor reading shows it's at Y now). The system needs a mechanism for **belief revision**: updating or removing incorrect nodes/edges to maintain consistency. This is challenging because the agent must decide *which* prior beliefs to retract or modify when a conflict arises. Approaches to manage uncertainty include attaching confidence scores or probabilities to each knowledge graph edge, using fuzzy logic or Bayesian updates. When contradictions occur, a conflict resolution policy or a **truth maintenance system** can be employed to revise the graph – for example, an *Invalidation Agent* process can automatically mark certain facts as outdated or invalid if new observations invalidate them. The graph must essentially support **non-monotonic updates** (the set of believed facts can shrink or change as new info comes). Designing efficient algorithms for belief revision in a graph (which might involve dependency tracking or rollback of inferences) is an open challenge.

* **Efficient Reasoning and Planning:** The knowledge graph should enable **fast reasoning** despite its complexity. Agents will query this graph constantly during planning ("find a path to room X that avoids obstacles" or "what tool can cut this rope?") and during decision-making ("have I seen this event before, what caused it last time?"). Ensuring that queries can be answered quickly as the graph grows is a challenge. Graph traversal and multi-hop reasoning can be expensive if the graph is large or densely connected. Strategies to address this include using graph databases or in-memory graph structures optimized for retrieval, indexing frequently accessed subgraphs, and pruning irrelevant information. For example, graph databases like Neo4j or distributed graph stores allow efficient relationship queries even at scale. The agent might also maintain different **layers of abstraction** – a coarse, high-level graph for broad planning and a detailed subgraph for local decisions – to limit the amount of data it needs to traverse at once. Another aspect of efficiency is integrating the graph with the agent's reasoning modules: modern agents that use large language models (LLMs) can be augmented with a graph-based memory to improve their planning. In such cases, bridging the LLM and the graph (e.g. via a query interface or embedding the graph context in prompts) must be done in a way that doesn't become a bottleneck. Overall, the system needs to support real-time reasoning over the knowledge graph for it to be practical in live environments.

* **Knowledge Transfer Between Agents:** If multiple agents are learning and operating in the same world, **sharing knowledge** can greatly accelerate learning – one agent's discoveries could benefit others. The challenge is enabling knowledge transfer or fusion **while preserving each agent's individuality**. Agents may have different perspectives or even conflicting information based on their distinct experiences. One approach is to maintain a **shared global knowledge graph** that all agents can read from and write to. This gives a common memory of "public" facts; indeed, systems have been proposed where multiple agents write to the *same evolving graph* with built-in version control. Techniques like **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)** and transactional updates can ensure consistency in a shared graph, avoiding race conditions and knowledge divergence. However, a fully shared graph might override an agent's personal experiences or preferences. Therefore, another strategy is for each agent to have its **own knowledge graph** but use a communication protocol to exchange information. In this case, when Agent A learns something, it can send a message or subgraph to Agent B; B then decides how to integrate that into its own graph (perhaps weighting it by trust or only accepting if it doesn't conflict with core beliefs). Preserving individuality may involve keeping certain beliefs as immutable or "core" to an agent (e.g. an agent's goals or identity could be stored in a protected part of the graph that isn't overridden by others). Designing effective knowledge fusion techniques – whether via a shared repository or peer-to-peer graph merging – is challenging, especially when agents might use different schemas or vocabularies. The system must align concepts (ontology alignment) and resolve discrepancies (if two agents report different locations for an object, whose info is taken?). Balancing collective learning with individual specialization is a key consideration here.

* **Scaling with World Complexity:** As the complexity of the environment grows, the knowledge graph can become enormous – potentially millions of nodes and edges representing myriad objects, places, events, and agents. **Scalability** is a major challenge on multiple fronts: memory usage, update latency, and query performance. A scalable system might need to **prune or compress** knowledge over time. For instance, the agent could implement **aging policies** where very old or infrequently used information is archived or summarized. Graph compression techniques (merging redundant nodes, abstracting specifics into higher-level concepts) can keep the graph tractable. Another aspect is distributing the graph: in a complex world, no single agent might hold the entire knowledge; the data might be partitioned by region or type and possibly stored across multiple servers or agent memory units. The system could shard the knowledge graph by time (e.g. keep recent events in fast storage, older events in slower storage) or by domain. Additionally, as the schema evolves (new types of relations or entities get added), the graph should accommodate it without needing complete reorganization. Monitoring tools are needed to detect when the graph is getting too large or inconsistent. In summary, the design must ensure that the knowledge graph approach remains viable as the world's complexity (and the agent's experience) scales up – using techniques like summarization, modularization, and efficient graph algorithms to manage growth.

The above challenges highlight why a naive approach (e.g. just logging everything the agent sees) is not sufficient. The system must intelligently **learn, curate, and maintain** the knowledge graph over the agent's lifetime, much like a human brain strengthening useful connections and pruning others. Next, we delve into specific research questions that arise from these challenges.

## Key Research Questions

To build an effective evolving knowledge graph system, several **research questions** need to be answered:

1. **How to extract structured knowledge from unstructured experiences?**
   Real-world experience comes in forms like raw sensor data, video streams, or natural language, none of which are immediately usable as a graph. The question is what methods can transform this unstructured input into the nodes and edges of a knowledge graph. One line of research is on **automated knowledge extraction pipelines**. For example, recent work on temporal agent memory suggests using an *Input Parser* to interpret raw observations (e.g. parsing a conversation transcript or an image), followed by an *Entity & Relation Extractor* that produces time-stamped triples. Projects like **Graphiti** go from "episodes" (an interaction, an observed event, etc.) to structured knowledge: for each episode, identify the entities involved, the relationships between them, the temporal context, and the factual assertions made. As an illustration, if an agent watches a human cook a meal, an episode might yield triples like (*Chef*, *chops*, *Carrot*) and (*Carrot*, *state*, *Diced*) with a timestamp. Techniques for this include leveraging **machine learning** – e.g. computer vision algorithms to detect objects and spatial relations in images, or NLP models to do **Open Information Extraction** on text describing the agent's observations. Large Language Models themselves can assist: an LLM can take a textual summary of an experience and output a set of triples or a JSON graph representation (essentially having the LLM "translate" unstructured data to structured form). Reinforcement learning agents can build graphs by exploration: for example, every time the agent tries an action, it can update a graph of states and transitions, gradually structuring its state-space model. Key challenges remain in making this extraction **incremental and real-time** (updating the graph on the fly as new data comes) and ensuring **accuracy** (not extracting spurious relations from coincidences). Multi-modal fusion is also hard – the agent might need to combine visual and textual cues to form a complete piece of knowledge. Research is ongoing into robust pipelines; for instance, one proposed architecture for long-term agent memory includes components for parsing inputs into events and relations, feeding into a graph store. The goal is to minimize manual engineering: instead of pre-coding knowledge, the system should **learn its ontology** and populate the graph from its own experience.

2. **What is the best graph representation for LLM-based reasoning?**
   With the rise of large language model agents, we need to determine how a knowledge graph should be structured and interfaced to support reasoning in concert with an LLM. A knowledge graph can be represented in various ways: the classic format is a collection of **triples** (subject–predicate–object) which correspond to edges in a graph. This RDF-style representation is simple and works well with symbolic reasoners and graph databases. Another option is a **property graph** (like those used in Neo4j) where nodes and edges can have attributes; this can encode richer context but is slightly more complex to serialize or parse. For LLM-based agents, an important consideration is how the model will *use* the graph. One approach is to let the LLM query the graph via a formal query language (such as SPARQL or Cypher) – effectively treating the knowledge graph as a tool. In fact, recent systems demonstrate **LLM + graph** synergy by allowing the LLM to issue structured queries that traverse the graph and retrieve information. For example, an LLM could be given a "graph traversal" function: it can ask, *Find the location of object X and what actions are possible with it*, which the system executes on the knowledge graph, returning the answer for the LLM to incorporate into its reasoning. This requires the graph representation to be compatible with tool use: a well-defined schema or ontology that the LLM can understand. Another consideration is human-readability and debuggability – representing knowledge in a graph that can also be described in natural language might help an LLM reason (some works on "graph-of-thought" use knowledge graphs as an intermediate representation for chain-of-thought reasoning). Ultimately, the "best" representation might be a hybrid: **text-plus-graph**, where factual knowledge is stored as a graph but extracted into text form (lists of triples or explanatory paragraphs) when feeding into the LLM's context. This provides structure with flexibility. It's also worth noting that knowledge graphs can be embedded in vector space (via knowledge graph embeddings) for neural reasoning, but LLMs benefit from explicit symbols for interpretability. In summary, the graph should be structured enough to capture complex relations (including temporal and causal aspects) yet accessible to the LLM. A promising direction is using **graph schemas aligned with LLM's internal knowledge** – for example, if the LLM was trained on common ontologies or can be fine-tuned to understand the agent's graph format. The representation question also ties into tooling: we want graph query results that are easy for the LLM to incorporate. Many current systems therefore opt for a straightforward triple store with a natural language-friendly schema, combined with a querying interface that the LLM can invoke.

3. **What methods handle belief revision when observations conflict?**
   As the agent accumulates knowledge, it will inevitably encounter new observations that conflict with what its knowledge graph currently believes. This raises the classic AI question of **belief revision**: how should the system update its knowledge base to accommodate new information while maintaining consistency? Several methods are being explored. One approach involves **temporal tagging** of knowledge: instead of outright deleting a fact, the agent can mark it as valid only in a certain time interval, and superseded by a newer fact. Temporal knowledge graphs naturally support this by allowing multiple time-stamped edges (e.g., "Location(A) = X **until** 10:00, then Location(A) = Y") and using the latest information for current reasoning. Another approach is using a **Truth Maintenance System (TMS)** or dependency graph of beliefs. In such systems, each piece of knowledge has justifications, and if a justification is contradicted or removed, the system knows to retract that belief. For the agent's knowledge graph, a simplified approach could be: when a direct conflict is detected (e.g., two different values for the same property at the same time), apply a policy – perhaps trust the more recent observation, or the one from a more reliable sensor, and remove or flag the old one. The *Memory Manager* component of a long-term memory architecture might perform operations like **aging, pruning, and conflict resolution** regularly. There's also research into **AGM belief revision principles** (from symbolic logic) applied to knowledge graphs, seeking minimal changes when incorporating new info. In multi-agent contexts, belief revision might involve negotiating conflicts (if Agent1's data conflicts with Agent2's). One concrete implementation from the literature is an *Invalidation Agent* in a temporal KG pipeline: whenever a new statement is added, it checks if an existing statement is now invalid (for example, a new fact "door is closed" would invalidate a prior fact "door is open") and updates the graph accordingly. Probabilistic approaches can also help: the graph could maintain multiple hypotheses with confidence levels and only eliminate a belief when another is significantly more likely. In summary, the agent needs a robust strategy for **belief change**. This remains an open research area, but likely it will involve a combination of **versioned knowledge (keeping track of past truths)**, **confidence-based update rules**, and possibly **explanation-based pruning** (removing a belief because its supporting evidence was disproven). The ability to revise knowledge on the fly is crucial for long-term accuracy of the agent's world model.

4. **How to share knowledge while preserving agent individuality?**
   In multi-agent systems, agents can greatly benefit from sharing what they learn – this is akin to a team of humans pooling their knowledge. However, unlike a centralized database, each agent has its own **individual perspective and objectives**, which we want to preserve. The question is: how can agents transfer or fuse knowledge without simply all becoming identical? One aspect is **knowledge provenance** – when an agent acquires knowledge from another, the graph might tag the source (which agent provided it) and perhaps a confidence or trust level. This way, agents can retain some healthy skepticism or personalization (e.g., "Agent B said the package is in Room 2, but my own sensors didn't confirm it, so I'll note it with uncertainty"). Technical mechanisms for sharing include a **common knowledge graph** accessible by all agents, which simplifies sharing but requires mechanisms to avoid write conflicts. Using a shared graph with built-in versioning (each entry annotated with timestamps and origin) can allow multiple agents to read/write concurrently. In such designs, to preserve individuality, not everything has to be shared – perhaps only a certain subset of facts (like public observations) go into the global graph, while private experiences remain in local subgraphs. Another approach is **peer-to-peer exchange**: agents query each other for information. For instance, if Agent A needs to know something it hasn't experienced, it could ask Agent B (in natural language or a formal query) and then incorporate B's answer into its graph if appropriate. This retains more independence but requires communication protocols and possibly translation between agents' internal schemas. Maintaining individuality could also mean each agent has a **core belief set that doesn't change** (or changes only very slowly), as suggested by some multi-agent belief models. This core could include the agent's mission, identity, or other foundational knowledge that isn't overridden by others. Everything outside that core is more fluid and can be updated from external inputs. Technically, knowledge fusion may need an **ontology alignment** step – agents might use different terms or structures for their knowledge, so converting another agent's knowledge into one's own representation is nontrivial. Tools like **schema mapping** or embedding-based alignment might help unify concepts. Lastly, when conflicting knowledge is shared (Agent X says thing A, Agent Y says thing B), the system could either favor one agent (perhaps a designated leader or based on reliability), or maintain multiple versions until resolved. In summary, preserving individuality means each agent's knowledge graph should remain partially unique, reflecting its own journey, while **selected knowledge is merged** through controlled sharing. Designing the rules and infrastructure for this selective sharing is a key research question for multi-agent knowledge systems.

5. **What are effective ways to visualize and debug these knowledge graphs?**
   With a constantly evolving, complex knowledge graph under the hood, it's crucial to have ways to **inspect, visualize, and debug** the agent's knowledge. Both developers and the agents themselves (if we consider self-reflection) need tools to understand what's in the graph and why. One straightforward approach is to use existing **graph visualization tools**. For example, Neo4j's browser or Graphviz can display nodes and edges; an agent's user profile or memory graph can be visualized to show how different facts are connected. Visualizing the graph helps in spotting anomalies, such as a node that shouldn't be there or an incorrect relation (e.g., two objects that should not logically be connected). For debugging, maintaining an **audit trail** of knowledge updates is very useful. Each entry in the graph can store metadata about *when* it was added and *by whom/what process*. This provenance information allows one to trace back: if a bizarre belief appears, we can see it was added by "Observation module at 3PM based on sensor reading X," helping identify sensor errors or extraction bugs. In essence, the knowledge graph should be **transparent**. Some systems explicitly design for this, making every knowledge entry **auditable and explainable** (who wrote it, when, and even why). For the agent, "debugging" its knowledge could mean the ability to run queries that check consistency (for example, a query to find any contradictory facts in the graph). Developers might define constraints (like no object can be in two places at once at the same time) and have an automated check that flags any violation in the graph. Visualization might also take the form of **natural language summaries** generated from the graph for easier understanding. An agent could be asked, "What do you know about object O?" and it could traverse the graph and answer in sentences, which is a form of introspection and debugging. For complex graphs, tools that allow filtering and layering (e.g., only show the causal subgraph, or only the last week of temporal data) make it easier to focus on relevant parts. Finally, interactive debugging tools could let a human correct the graph – for instance, manually remove an incorrect edge or merge duplicate nodes (e.g., if "Bob" and "Robert" were erroneously separate). In developing these agents, having a **graph query language** at hand (like Cypher or SPARQL) is invaluable: one can write queries to pull out specific slices of the agent's memory for examination or to verify that learning algorithms are updating the graph correctly. Overall, good visualization and debugging capabilities are not just conveniences – they are essential for **trustworthy AI**, as they provide insight into the agent's knowledge and reasoning process, helping ensure the system's decisions can be explained by the contents of its knowledge graph.

## Design Considerations and Requirements

Based on the challenges and questions discussed, we can outline several design requirements for a system of agents with evolving knowledge graphs:

* **Incremental Learning Algorithm:** The system needs an algorithm (or suite of algorithms) for **continual, incremental learning** of the graph. Rather than building the knowledge graph once and freezing it, the agent should update it **online** as new data arrives. This implies support for adding new nodes/edges on the fly, updating attributes, and removing or marking obsolete entries. The learning algorithm could be event-driven: each time the agent perceives something noteworthy, it triggers an update to the graph. Crucially, this should happen without requiring retraining of the entire model. For instance, one can design the agent's memory such that it **persists knowledge in the graph instead of solely in the weights of an LLM**, allowing adaptation via graph updates rather than gradient descent. This greatly improves efficiency and avoids catastrophic forgetting – new experiences expand or adjust the graph, but the existing structure remains unless evidence prompts change. The incremental learning mechanism might incorporate **feedback** as well (if the agent makes a wrong inference, a corrective input could adjust the graph). Additionally, it should handle the growth of knowledge gracefully: perhaps periodically summarizing or compressing parts of the graph as needed (so learning doesn't slow down over time). In summary, the design must facilitate **lifelong learning**, where each experience tweaks the knowledge graph in a cumulative way.

* **Query Interface and Graph Traversal Language:** To use the knowledge graph in reasoning and planning, we need a **query mechanism** that the agent (and developers) can use to retrieve information. This could be a formal query language like SPARQL (for RDF triples) or Cypher (for property graphs), or even a custom API that provides functions like `find_path(entity1, entity2)` or `get_relation(entity, relation_type)`. A well-defined query language or API ensures that the agent's planning module or LLM can ask complex questions involving multi-hop relationships. For example, an agent might query "what objects are in the same room as the target and can be used to reach it?" which might translate to a graph traversal. **Declarative queries** are powerful – a developer or agent can specify *what* it wants (e.g. "fetch entities the user interacted with in the last week") and the graph engine handles *how* to get it. In fact, using a graph query instead of hardcoded prompt engineering can yield precise memory retrieval. The system might integrate this with the agent's LLM by allowing the LLM to generate graph queries as needed. For efficient operation, the query interface should support constraints (temporal filters, uncertainty thresholds) so that, for instance, an agent can ask for "latest location of X with confidence > 0.8". Having a robust query language also aids debugging and visualization as noted. Therefore, the architecture should include a **graph query processor** and possibly an optimization layer (to handle frequent query patterns quickly via indexing). The query interface essentially bridges the gap between the agent's decision-making and its stored knowledge, so it must be designed for ease of use and expressiveness.

* **Uncertainty Representation and Reasoning:** Given the uncertain nature of learned knowledge, the system must include methods for **uncertainty quantification** in the graph. This means each piece of knowledge could carry a measure of confidence or a probability. Designing the representation could involve having weighted edges (e.g., an edge labeled *CAUSES* might have an 80% confidence score if the agent has seen the effect 4 out of 5 times). Alternatively, nodes might have probability distributions over possible values (like a belief that an object is either in location A (70% chance) or location B (30%)). The system could use a **probabilistic graph model** or attach a separate belief metadata layer on top of the deterministic graph. The benefit is that the agent can make decisions that account for uncertainty – e.g., it might hedge or seek more information if the relevant knowledge is uncertain. Additionally, the reasoning engine should be able to propagate these uncertainties (some approaches use Bayesian networks or Markov logic networks to do probabilistic inference on graphs). Another technique is **fuzzy logic** for affordances and spatial relations that are not binary. The design should also consider **how to update uncertainties**: as new observations come in, confidence in some edges should increase or decrease. For instance, multiple confirmations of the same relation should bolster its credibility, whereas conflicting evidence should reduce confidence or trigger re-evaluation. In practice, implementing full probabilistic reasoning can be complex and computationally heavy. A pragmatic design might use a simpler heuristic approach: maintain confidence scores and thresholds for action (only act on knowledge above a certain certainty, etc.). In any case, representing uncertainty is vital for a realistic agent – the world is rarely black-and-white, and the agent's knowledge graph should reflect shades of gray when needed. This also ties into belief revision: a new observation might not entirely delete an old belief but instead lower its confidence. The architecture could incorporate an **uncertainty module** that manages these calculations and updates.

* **Knowledge Fusion from Multiple Agents:** When multiple agents contribute to a knowledge base, the design must support **knowledge fusion** – combining inputs from different agents into a coherent whole. If a shared graph approach is used, this means the system needs to handle concurrent updates, merging of knowledge, and conflict resolution as discussed. Techniques such as **CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types)** or transaction-based systems can allow merges without central coordination, which is useful if agents are distributed. The knowledge graph might record the source of each piece of knowledge (Agent ID or experience ID) to keep track of provenance. This not only preserves credit but also allows filtering (one agent might choose to trust only facts that at least 2 other agents agree on, for example). If the agents have separate graphs that need to sync occasionally, the system should provide a protocol for graph merging: aligning entities (are "obj\_12" in Agent A's graph and "rock\_7" in Agent B's graph the same object?), merging nodes that refer to the same real-world entity, and reconciling any differences in relations. The design might include a **shared ontology or schema** to ease this alignment – e.g., all agents adhere to a common set of relation types and ID conventions for common entities. Preserving individuality means perhaps not everything is merged; so the system could label certain knowledge as **personal vs shared**. For shared parts, an update from one agent propagates to the others. This could be done through a **publish/subscribe system**: agents publish new learned facts to a channel, and others subscribe and decide whether to incorporate those facts. The system should also consider performance: merging large graphs can be expensive, so it might restrict fusion to summarized knowledge rather than raw detailed experiences. Additionally, to avoid overwhelming agents with too much data from peers, the design might implement **knowledge filtering** – e.g., only share information about areas or topics that another agent is likely to need. Evaluation of knowledge fusion strategies is important: the design should ensure that sharing actually improves each agent's performance (the whole should be greater than the sum of parts) and that it doesn't introduce systemic errors (one agent's wrong observation could mislead all if not checked). In essence, the requirement is to enable agents to **learn collectively** in a scalable and controlled way, which is a distinguishing feature of a multi-agent knowledge graph system.

* **Evaluation Metrics for Knowledge Quality:** Finally, the system design must include ways to **evaluate the quality of the knowledge graph** and its contribution to the agent's performance. Unlike static knowledge bases, an evolving graph can't be easily evaluated by a fixed benchmark of facts. We need metrics that capture how useful and correct the agent's learned knowledge is. Some possible evaluation criteria: **accuracy** (percentage of graph entries that are correct, when compared to ground truth in a simulated environment or expert labels), **consistency** (absence of logical contradictions in the graph), **coverage** (does the graph contain the necessary facts to support the tasks the agent must perform), and **efficiency** (does using the graph enable faster or more successful task completion than not using it). There may also be metrics for **timeliness** (how quickly the graph incorporates new information – reflecting adaptability) and **compression** (how well the graph avoids redundant or irrelevant info). Another angle is evaluating **reasoning performance**: for example, one can test the agent on question-answering or planning tasks that require multi-step reasoning to see if the knowledge graph yields correct answers. If multiple agents are involved, we might evaluate **knowledge transfer efficiency**: how much faster does a naive agent learn a task if it can import knowledge from a knowledgeable agent, versus learning alone? In the design, it's wise to build in some automated evaluation or monitoring: e.g., have periodic tests the agent runs using its knowledge (like consistency checks or simulated scenarios to verify predictions). Additionally, user feedback can be a metric – if the agent is an assistant, does it give fewer incorrect answers over time as its knowledge graph grows? Designing these metrics will guide the development: for instance, if consistency is an issue, more robust revision methods might be needed; if coverage is low, the extraction component may need improvement. Ultimately, the knowledge graph's quality should be measured by **its impact on the agent's overall goals**. If the agent is a household robot, does the knowledge graph help it perform tasks more autonomously and safely over time? If it's an AI assistant, does the knowledge graph make its responses more accurate and context-aware? The evaluation framework should link back to such high-level outcomes. By including clear metrics and tests in the design, we ensure the system's learning process remains on track and we can objectively verify improvements in the agent's world understanding.

## Conclusion

Building a system of agents that can construct and maintain an evolving knowledge graph of their world is an ambitious but achievable goal. By integrating spatial, temporal, causal, affordance-based, and social knowledge into a unified graph, agents gain a rich, structured understanding that supports advanced reasoning and planning. This approach moves AI agents closer to human-like cognitive abilities – the capacity to remember past experiences, abstract general knowledge, and share information socially. We discussed how such a system must learn from experience and handle uncertainty, continuously revising its beliefs to stay aligned with reality. The synergy of knowledge graphs with modern AI (like LLM-based agents) offers new opportunities: graphs provide **explicit memory and relational reasoning** that complements the pattern recognition of neural models. Challenges remain in ensuring scalability and consistency, but ongoing research (e.g. on temporal knowledge graphs for memory and graph-based multi-agent coordination) is rapidly advancing the state of the art. The design considerations outlined – from incremental learning algorithms to provenance-rich debugging tools – form a roadmap for implementing these ideas. In essence, an evolving knowledge graph serves as the **"brain" of an autonomous agent**, growing and adapting with the agent's experience. With careful design, such systems can enable agents that not only act and react, but also **learn, reason, and collaborate** in complex, dynamic worlds. The continued exploration of this paradigm will be key to developing the next generation of intelligent, adaptive agents.
