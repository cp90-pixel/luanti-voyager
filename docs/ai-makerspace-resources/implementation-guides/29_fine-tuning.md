# Fine-tuning - Luanti Implementation Guide

# Fine-Tuning Implementation Guide for Luanti Voyager

## Executive Summary
Fine-tuning is an advanced AI technique that enhances the capabilities of AI agents in Luanti Voyager by allowing them to adapt to specific scenarios and player behaviors within the game environment. This enhancement enables AI agents to perform tasks more efficiently, react more intelligently to player actions, and improve overall gameplay dynamics. For players, this means a richer and more engaging experience with intelligent adversaries or teammates. Performance-wise, fine-tuning introduces computational overhead, but careful optimization can ensure minimal impact on frame rates and system resources.

## Core Architecture

### System Design
The Fine-Tuning System consists of several key components:
1. **Data Collection Module**: Collects data from game events for training purposes.
2. **Training Module**: Processes collected data to fine-tune AI models.
3. **Inference Engine**: Applies fine-tuned models to drive agent behavior during gameplay.
4. **Integration Layer**: Synchronizes the Fine-Tuning System with the Luanti Voyager game engine.

### Data Flow Diagram
- **Data Collection**: The game engine sends real-time data (e.g., player actions, environment changes) to the Data Collection Module.
- **Training Process**: Collected data is processed by the Training Module to adjust AI models.
- **Inference Execution**: Fine-tuned models are used in the Inference Engine to influence agent behavior.
- **Feedback Loop**: The system continuously collects new data and refines models, creating a cycle of improvement.

### Integration Points with Game Engine
The Fine-Tuning System integrates with the Luanti Voyager game engine via API hooks. These hooks allow for seamless communication between the game environment and AI system:
- **Event Hooks**: Capture player actions and game state changes.
- **Model Interface**: Load and apply fine-tuned models to control agent behavior.

from dataclasses import dataclass
import asyncio
import json
from datetime import datetime


@dataclass
class GameEvent:
    timestamp: float
    event_type: str
    data: Dict[str, Any]


class FineTuningSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.config = {
            "overview": "Advanced AI technique: Fine-tuning",
            "key_concepts": [],
            "game_applications": [],
            "implementation_hints": []
        }
        self.model = None  # Placeholder for the actual model
        self.events_buffer: List[GameEvent] = []

    def process(self, input_data):
        if not self.model:
            raise ValueError("Model is not initialized")
        try:
            processed_output = self.model.predict(input_data)
            return processed_output
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during model processing: {e}")
            return None

    async def collect_event(self, event_type: str, data: Dict[str, Any]):
        timestamp = datetime.now().timestamp()
        game_event = GameEvent(timestamp=timestamp, event_type=event_type, data=data)
        self.events_buffer.append(game_event)

    async def train_model(self):
        if not self.events_buffer:
            print("No events to train on")
            return
        # Example training logic (simplified)
        training_data = np.array([event.data for event in self.events_buffer])
        self.model.fit(training_data)  # Assuming model has a fit method
        self.events_buffer.clear()

    async def inference(self, input_data):
        try:
            output = self.process(input_data)
            return output
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Inference error: {e}")
            return None

# Example usage
async def main():
    ft_system = FineTuningSystem()
    await ft_system.collect_event("player_move", {"position": (1, 2, 3)})
    await ft_system.train_model()
    result = await ft_system.inference({"sensors": [0.5, 0.6]})
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Error Handling and Edge Cases
- **Model Initialization**: Ensure the model is properly initialized before processing.
- **Empty Events Buffer**: Handle cases where no events are collected for training.
- **Inference Errors**: Capture and log errors during inference.

### Configuration Options
- `model_path`: Path to save or load trained models.
- `training_interval`: Frequency of model training (e.g., after every 100 events).

## Game-Specific Optimizations

### Tick Rate Considerations
- Fine-tuning should be performed at a lower frequency compared to game ticks to minimize performance impact. For example, training could occur every few seconds or minutes.

### Memory Management
- Efficiently manage memory usage by periodically clearing the events buffer and optimizing model storage.

### Multiplayer Synchronization
- Ensure that fine-tuning does not introduce latency issues in multiplayer scenarios. Implement synchronization mechanisms to handle concurrent data processing.

## Agent Behavior Examples

### Example 1: Enhanced Enemy AI
**Before**: Enemies follow basic scripted paths.
**After**: Enemies dynamically adjust strategies based on player movements and patterns.

### Example 2: Improved NPC Interaction
**Before**: NPCs respond with generic dialogue.
**After**: NPCs engage in context-aware conversations, adapting to player choices and actions.

### Example 3: Adaptive Terrain Navigation
**Before**: Agents navigate terrain using fixed algorithms.
**After**: Agents learn optimal paths based on environmental changes and previous experiences.

### Example 4: Collaborative Teamwork
**Before**: Team members perform tasks independently.
**After**: Team members coordinate actions, sharing information to achieve common goals more efficiently.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests for Core Components
- Test data collection by simulating game events and verifying buffer contents.
- Validate model training logic with mock data.
- Ensure error handling works as expected.

### Integration Tests with Game Engine
- Integrate the Fine-Tuning System with Luanti Voyager and verify real-time data flow.
- Confirm that model updates influence agent behavior correctly.

### Performance Benchmarks
- Measure system performance under various conditions (e.g., number of agents, event frequency).
- Optimize training intervals to balance accuracy and responsiveness.

## Deployment Checklist

### Configuration Steps
- Set up the Fine-Tuning System with necessary configuration options.
- Ensure API hooks are correctly implemented in the game engine.

### Monitoring Setup
- Implement logging for system performance metrics.
- Monitor model accuracy and agent behavior over time.

### Rollback Procedures
- Maintain a backup of previous model versions.
- Have a rollback plan in case of deployment issues or performance degradation.

## Advanced Patterns

### Scaling to Many Agents
- Use distributed computing resources to handle large numbers of agents simultaneously.
- Implement load balancing strategies to distribute computational tasks efficiently.

### Player Interaction Patterns
- Analyze player interaction data to identify common behaviors and patterns.
- Fine-tune models based on these interactions to improve agent responsiveness.

### Emergent Behaviors
- Encourage the emergence of complex behaviors by allowing agents to learn from diverse scenarios.
- Monitor and analyze emergent behaviors to refine training algorithms and enhance gameplay experience.
