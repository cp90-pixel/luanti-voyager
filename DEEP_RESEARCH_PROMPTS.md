## üß† Skill Learning & Code Generation

### Prompt 1: Neurosymbolic Skill Architecture

```
I'm designing a neurosymbolic learning system for an embodied AI agent in a voxel world (Luanti/Minetest). The agent needs to:

1. Generate executable code (Lua/Python) from natural language goals
2. Learn from both successes and failures
3. Compose simple skills into complex behaviors
4. Maintain a versioned library of learned skills

Current context:
- Agent receives world state as JSON (position, blocks, inventory)
- Can execute actions: move, place_block, mine_block, craft
- Has access to an LLM for reasoning
- Must operate safely without damaging the environment

Please help me design:
1. The optimal skill representation format (considering both neural and symbolic aspects)
2. A safe code generation pipeline with validation
3. Methods for skill composition and dependency management
4. Metrics for evaluating skill quality and generalization
5. A curriculum learning approach that builds complexity gradually

Consider papers like Voyager, CodeAsPolicy, and Toolformer. What innovations could we add to push beyond current state-of-the-art?
```

### Prompt 2: Self-Improving Code Generation

```
Design a self-improving code generation system for game agents that:

1. Starts with basic movement/interaction primitives
2. Learns to write increasingly complex programs
3. Can debug its own code when failures occur
4. Transfers knowledge between similar tasks

Requirements:
- Must handle partial observability (agent has limited vision)
- Should work with any LLM backend (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
- Needs to be compute-efficient for open-source use
- Must maintain safety constraints

Specific questions:
1. How should we structure the prompt engineering for reliable code generation?
2. What's the best way to handle syntax errors and runtime failures?
3. How can we implement efficient skill retrieval and reuse?
4. Should skills be pure functions or stateful objects?
5. How do we balance exploration vs exploitation in skill learning?

Include concrete examples and implementation strategies.
