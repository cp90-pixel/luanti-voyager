# Guardrails - Luanti Implementation Guide

# Implementation Guide for Integrating Guardrails into Luanti Voyager

## Executive Summary

Integrating **Guardrails** into Luanti Voyager, an open-source Minecraft-like game, enhances the AI agents' behavior by defining safe and effective boundaries within which they operate. This ensures that AI behaviors remain aligned with game objectives and player expectations. The Guardrails system provides a robust framework for managing complex interactions between AI agents and the environment, thereby enhancing gameplay experience without compromising performance.

**Value to Players:**
Players benefit from a more predictable and enjoyable gaming environment where AI-driven elements behave intelligently but safely. This reduces frustration arising from unpredictable or adversarial AI actions, promoting a smoother and more engaging user experience.

**Performance Implications:**
The Guardrails system is designed to have minimal overhead, ensuring that it does not significantly impact the game's performance. Efficient data processing and memory management techniques are employed to maintain optimal gameplay responsiveness even with a large number of active agents.

## Core Architecture

### System Design
The Guardrails system consists of several key components:
- **GuardrailsSystem**: The main class responsible for managing guardrail configurations and processing agent actions.
- **ConfigManager**: Manages the loading and updating of configuration files.
- **RuleEvaluator**: Evaluates whether agent actions comply with predefined rules.
- **ActionHandler**: Processes compliant actions and enforces non-compliant ones.

### Data Flow Diagram
1. **Initialization**: The `GuardrailsSystem` is initialized with a configuration file that defines guardrail rules.
2. **Input Processing**: Agent actions are sent to the `GuardrailsSystem`.
3. **Rule Evaluation**: The `RuleEvaluator` checks if actions comply with predefined rules.
4. **Action Handling**: Compliant actions are processed by the `ActionHandler`, while non-compliant ones are either modified or discarded.
5. **Feedback Loop**: Outcomes of action processing are fed back to the game engine for further updates.

### Integration Points
- **Agent Actions**: Guardrails intercept agent actions before they are executed, ensuring compliance with rules.
- **Game Engine Updates**: The system interacts with the game engine to update agent states based on processed actions.
- **Configuration Management**: Configuration files can be dynamically loaded or updated without restarting the game.

## Detailed Implementation

### Complete Code Example
```python
# Guardrails Implementation for Luanti Voyager
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass
import asyncio
import json
from datetime import datetime


@dataclass
class Action:
    type: str
    parameters: Dict[str, Any]


class ConfigManager:
    def __init__(self, config_path: str):
        self.config_path = config_path
        self.load_config()

    def load_config(self) -> None:
        with open(self.config_path, 'r') as file:
            self.config = json.load(file)

    def get_rule(self, action_type: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
        return self.config.get('rules', {}).get(action_type)


class RuleEvaluator:
    def __init__(self, config_manager: ConfigManager):
        self.config_manager = config_manager

    def evaluate(self, action: Action) -> bool:
        rule = self.config_manager.get_rule(action.type)
        if not rule:
            return True  # No rules for this action type
        return all(rule[key] == value for key, value in action.parameters.items())


class ActionHandler:
    async def process_action(self, action: Action) -> None:
        print(f"Processing action: {action}")
        # Simulate some asynchronous processing
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print(f"Action processed: {action}")


class GuardrailsSystem:
    def __init__(self, config_path: str):
        self.config_manager = ConfigManager(config_path)
        self.rule_evaluator = RuleEvaluator(self.config_manager)
        self.action_handler = ActionHandler()

    async def process(self, input_data: List[Action]) -> None:
        for action in input_data:
            if self.rule_evaluator.evaluate(action):
                await self.action_handler.process_action(action)
            else:
                print(f"Action {action} is non-compliant and will be skipped.")


# Example usage
async def main():
    guardrails_system = GuardrailsSystem('config.json')
    actions = [
        Action(type='move', parameters={'direction': 'north'}),
        Action(type='attack', parameters={'target': 'mob'})
    ]
    await guardrails_system.process(actions)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Error Handling and Edge Cases
- **Missing Configuration**: The system gracefully handles missing configuration files by raising an exception.
- **Non-compliant Actions**: Non-compliant actions are skipped, and a message is logged for debugging purposes.

### Configuration Options
- **Rules File**: A JSON file defining action types and their associated rules.
  ```json
  {
      "rules": {
          "move": {"direction": ["north", "south", "east", "west"]},
          "attack": {"target": ["mob"]}
      }
  }
  ```

## Game-Specific Optimizations

### Tick Rate Considerations
- **Synchronous vs Asynchronous**: The Guardrails system is designed to work with both synchronous and asynchronous action processing, ensuring compatibility with Luanti Voyager's tick rate.

### Memory Management
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Use of lightweight data structures like `Action` dataclass for efficient memory usage.
- **Garbage Collection**: Regularly clean up unused objects to prevent memory leaks.

### Multiplayer Synchronization
- **Synchronized Configuration Updates**: Ensure that configuration updates are synchronized across all game instances in a multiplayer setting.
- **Consistent Rule Evaluation**: Rules must be evaluated consistently on all clients to maintain fairness and predictability.

## Agent Behavior Examples

### Scenario 1: Movement with Guardrails
**Before:** AI agents move randomly, sometimes leading them into dangerous areas.
**After:** AI agents move only in defined directions (north, south, east, west), avoiding dangerous areas.

### Scenario 2: Attack Behavior
**Before:** AI agents attack anything indiscriminately.
**After:** AI agents attack only specific targets (e.g., mobs).

### Scenario 3: Resource Gathering
**Before:** AI agents gather resources without prioritization.
**After:** AI agents prioritize gathering essential resources based on predefined rules.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests for Core Components
- **ConfigManager**: Test loading and retrieving configuration data.
- **RuleEvaluator**: Verify rule evaluation logic with various action types.
- **ActionHandler**: Ensure asynchronous processing handles actions correctly.

### Integration Tests with Game Engine
- **GuardrailsSystem**: Integrate with the game engine to test full lifecycle of agent actions from input to execution.

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Latency Testing**: Measure time taken for Guardrails system to process actions.
- **Stress Testing**: Evaluate performance under high loads (many agents, complex rules).

## Deployment Checklist

### Configuration Steps
1. Deploy configuration files (`config.json`) to the game server or client directories.
2. Ensure all dependencies (e.g., `numpy`, `asyncio`) are installed.

### Monitoring Setup
- **Logging**: Implement logging for critical operations and errors.
- **Performance Metrics**: Track latency, memory usage, and CPU utilization of Guardrails system.

### Rollback Procedures
1. Revert to previous configuration files if issues arise.
2. Roll back code changes using version control (e.g., Git).

## Advanced Patterns

### Scaling to Many Agents
- **Parallel Processing**: Use parallel processing techniques to handle large numbers of agents simultaneously.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute workload across multiple servers or threads.

### Player Interaction Patterns
- **Dynamic Guardrails**: Allow guardrail rules to change based on player interactions (e.g., adjusting difficulty levels).
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Provide feedback to players regarding AI behavior and rule compliance.

### Emergent Behaviors
- **Learning Systems**: Implement learning systems that adapt guardrail rules based on emerging behaviors.
- **Player Customization**: Allow players to customize guardrail rules to fit their gameplay style.

By following this comprehensive implementation guide, you can seamlessly integrate Guardrails into Luanti Voyager, enhancing AI behavior while ensuring optimal performance and a smooth player experience.
