# GPT-OSS Video Analysis Status

## ðŸš€ Current Status: ANALYZING

The LLM is currently analyzing the full transcript of the GPT-OSS video. This process will take approximately 5-10 minutes.

### What's Happening Now:
- **Process ID**: Check `cat docs/video-analysis/analysis.pid`
- **Model**: gpt-oss:120b via Ollama
- **Input**: 54,276 character transcript about GPT-OSS and Harmony Response Format
- **Expected Output**: Comprehensive technical analysis including:
  - Code structures and formats mentioned in the video
  - Harmony Response Format details
  - Channel implementations
  - Comparison between GPT-OSS and GPT-4/5
  - Technical architecture and deployment considerations

### Files Already Processed:
âœ… **Video**: 335MB, 1080p, ~63 minutes
âœ… **Audio**: 90MB MP3 extracted
âœ… **Transcript**: Complete transcription with Whisper Large v3
âœ… **Frames**: 657 frames detected (though code extraction wasn't successful for presentation slides)
âœ… **Renamed**: Files renamed from "Multi_Agent_Systems" to "GPT_OSS_Harmony_Response_Format"

### To Check Progress:
```bash
# Quick status check
./scripts/check_gpt_oss_analysis.sh

# Watch live logs
tail -f docs/video-analysis/gpt_oss_analysis.log

# Check if still running
ps -p $(cat docs/video-analysis/analysis.pid)

# Check Ollama connection
lsof -p $(cat docs/video-analysis/analysis.pid) | grep 11434
```

### Expected Outputs:
When complete, you'll find:
1. `docs/video-analysis/multi-agent-systems/analysis/nyb3TnUkwE8_GPT_OSS_Harmony_Response_Format_llm_analysis.json` - Full analysis data
2. `docs/video-analysis/multi-agent-systems/analysis/GPT_OSS_Analysis_Report.md` - Human-readable report

### Key Topics Being Analyzed:
From the transcript, the LLM is extracting information about:
- **Harmony Response Format**: The "next generation" of system/user/assistant prompting with 5 options and sub-options (channels)
- **GPT-OSS Characteristics**: Open-source, deployable on-premises, "small-ish" model
- **Technical Details**: Why the model is described as "deep fried" and what that indicates
- **Code Patterns**: Any code structures, JSON formats, or implementation patterns mentioned
- **Practical Applications**: When to use GPT-OSS vs API models like GPT-4/5

### Sample Transcript Quotes Being Analyzed:
> "The open source model that's kind of small-ish that you can deploy on-prem is actually solving a way different problem than things we'll use GPT-5 or GPT-4-0"

> "This Harmony response format, it does appear like it's the kind of next generation of system user assistant prompting... When we go from sort of three options to five options and then sub options within them"

> "We'll discuss not just the response format, but some of those sub options called channels"

## Time Estimate
Started: Check `ls -l docs/video-analysis/gpt_oss_analysis.log` for start time
Expected completion: 5-10 minutes from start
The Ollama model needs to process ~30,000 tokens of input and generate ~8,000 tokens of analysis.
