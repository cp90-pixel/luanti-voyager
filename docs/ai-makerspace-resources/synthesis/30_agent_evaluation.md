# Implementation Guide: Agent Evaluation for Luanti Voyager

## Executive Summary
Agent Evaluation is an advanced AI technique designed to enhance the decision-making processes of AI agents within Luanti Voyager, an open-source Minecraft-like game. This system evaluates and refines agent behaviors in real-time based on predefined criteria such as resource management, strategic positioning, and combat effectiveness. For players, this means more challenging, unpredictable, and engaging gameplay experiences. Performance-wise, while there is a computational overhead, the benefits in terms of AI behavior quality outweigh these costs, making it a worthwhile integration.

## Core Architecture

### System Design
The Agent Evaluation System consists of several key components:
1. **Agent Evaluator**: Processes agent actions and provides feedback.
2. **Behavior Tree Manager**: Manages the decision-making process for agents based on evaluator feedback.
3. **Data Collector**: Gathers data from in-game interactions.
4. **Configuration Loader**: Loads system settings.

### Data Flow Diagram
- **Agents** send their current state (position, resources, actions) to the **Agent Evaluator**.
- The **Evaluator** processes this data and provides a score or feedback to the **Behavior Tree Manager**.
- The **Manager** uses this feedback to adjust agent behavior for subsequent ticks.
- The **Data Collector** logs all interactions and evaluations for analysis.
- The **Configuration Loader** ensures that the system settings are correctly applied.

### Integration Points
- **Game Engine Hooks**: Agents must send their state and receive updates from the evaluator at each tick.
- **Behavior Trees**: The evaluator's feedback should influence the decision-making process of the behavior tree.
- **Logging Interface**: Data collection must be seamlessly integrated into the game's logging system for analysis.

## Detailed Implementation

### Core Implementation
```python
# Agent Evaluation Implementation for Luanti Voyager
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass
import asyncio
import json
from datetime import datetime


@dataclass
class AgentState:
    position: tuple
    resources: dict
    actions: list

class AgentEvaluationSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize based on context
        self.config = {
            "overview": "Advanced AI technique: Agent Evaluation",
            "key_concepts": [],
            "game_applications": [],
            "implementation_hints": []
        }
        self.data_collector = DataCollector()

    def process(self, input_data: List[AgentState]) -> List[Dict[str, float]]:
        # Main processing logic
        evaluations = [self.evaluate_agent(state) for state in input_data]
        return evaluations

    def evaluate_agent(self, agent_state: AgentState) -> Dict[str, float]:
        score = 0.5  # Default score
        if 'resources' in agent_state.resources:
            score += self.resource_evaluation(agent_state.resources)
        if 'position' in agent_state.position:
            score += self.position_evaluation(agent_state.position)
        return {"agent_id": id(agent_state), "score": score}

    def resource_evaluation(self, resources: dict) -> float:
        # Simple evaluation logic
        return sum(resources.values()) / 10.0

    def position_evaluation(self, position: tuple) -> float:
        # Simple evaluation logic
        return (position[0] + position[1]) % 2

class DataCollector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logs = []

    def log_data(self, data: Any):
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
        self.logs.append({"timestamp": timestamp, "data": data})

# Example usage
async def main():
    evaluator = AgentEvaluationSystem()
    agents = [AgentState(position=(10, 20), resources={"wood": 5, "stone": 3}, actions=["mine", "build"])]
    evaluations = evaluator.process(agents)
    for evaluation in evaluations:
        print(evaluation)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Error Handling and Edge Cases
- **Agent State Missing Data**: The system should handle cases where some data is missing by providing default values or logging an error.
- **Invalid Agent States**: Ensure that invalid agent states (e.g., negative resource counts) are caught and corrected.

### Configuration Options
- **Evaluation Criteria Weights**: Adjust the weights of different evaluation criteria to reflect game design priorities.
- **Data Logging Toggle**: Enable or disable data logging based on performance requirements and analysis needs.

## Game-Specific Optimizations

### Tick Rate Considerations
- **Tick Frequency**: Ensure that evaluations do not occur too frequently, as this can degrade performance. Balance the need for real-time evaluation with computational efficiency.

### Memory Management
- **Data Storage Optimization**: Use efficient data structures (e.g., numpy arrays) to minimize memory usage.
- **Garbage Collection**: Implement strategies to clear old or unnecessary data from memory.

### Multiplayer Synchronization
- **Distributed Evaluation**: For multiplayer games, distribute evaluation tasks across multiple servers to ensure low latency and high throughput.

## Agent Behavior Examples

### Scenario 1: Resource Gathering vs. Combat
- **Before Evaluation**: Agents gather resources indiscriminately without considering combat threats.
- **After Evaluation**: Agents prioritize gathering in safe areas or defend themselves when under attack.

### Scenario 2: Strategic Positioning
- **Before Evaluation**: Agents position randomly without strategic advantage.
- **After Evaluation**: Agents position to control key resource nodes and choke points.

### Scenario 3: Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment
- **Before Evaluation**: Difficulty is static, leading to either too easy or too hard experiences.
- **After Evaluation**: Difficulty adjusts based on player performance and agent evaluation scores.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests for Core Components
```python
import unittest

class TestAgentEvaluationSystem(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.evaluator = AgentEvaluationSystem()

    def test_evaluate_agent_with_resources_and_position(self):
        state = AgentState(position=(10, 20), resources={"wood": 5, "stone": 3}, actions=["mine", "build"])
        evaluation = self.evaluator.evaluate_agent(state)
        self.assertIn("score", evaluation)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### Integration Tests with Game Engine
- **Mock Data**: Use mock data to simulate in-game agent states and verify that evaluations are performed correctly.
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure the impact of real-time evaluations on game performance.

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Throughput Testing**: Determine how many agents can be evaluated per second without significant performance degradation.
- **Latency Testing**: Ensure that evaluations do not introduce unacceptable latency into the game loop.

## Deployment Checklist

### Configuration Steps
- **Environment Setup**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and configured correctly.
- **Configuration File Validation**: Validate configuration files for errors or misconfigurations before deployment.

### Monitoring Setup
- **Real-Time Metrics**: Implement real-time monitoring of evaluation performance and system health.
- **Alerting Systems**: Set up alerts for any performance degradation or anomalies detected during operation.

### Rollback Procedures
- **Backup Configurations**: Maintain backups of previous configurations to facilitate quick rollbacks if needed.
- **Version Control**: Use version control to manage changes to the codebase, enabling easy rollback to a previous stable state.

## Advanced Patterns

### Scaling to Many Agents
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilize parallel processing techniques to evaluate multiple agents simultaneously.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute evaluation tasks across multiple nodes to balance computational load.

### Player Interaction Patterns
- **Agent Learning from Players**: Implement systems where agent behaviors are influenced by player actions, leading to emergent strategies.
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Adjust difficulty dynamically based on player skill and behavior patterns.

### Emergent Behaviors
- **Behavior Evolution**: Allow agents to evolve their behaviors over time based on evaluation feedback and learning algorithms.
- **Complex Strategies**: Encourage the emergence of complex strategic interactions between agents and players.
