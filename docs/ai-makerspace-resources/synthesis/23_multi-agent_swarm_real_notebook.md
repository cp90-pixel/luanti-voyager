# Implementation Guide: Integrating Multi-Agent Swarm into Luanti Voyager

## Executive Summary

Integrating a Multi-Agent Swarm framework from OpenAI into Luanti Voyager, an open-source Minecraft-like game, will enhance AI capabilities within the game environment. This implementation enables dynamic and interactive NPC (Non-Player Character) behaviors, allowing them to perform tasks such as news broadcasting, weather reporting, and other activities that enrich player experience. By leveraging the swarm architecture, developers can create a more immersive and responsive world where NPCs interact with each other and the players in meaningful ways.

## Core Architecture

The core architecture involves setting up an agent-based system where multiple AI agents can operate independently yet coordinate to achieve game objectives. The approach from the notebook will be adapted to fit within Luanti Voyager's existing framework. This includes defining agents with specific roles, setting context variables relevant to the game world, and integrating tools that allow these agents to perform tasks like weather reporting.

### Steps for Adaptation:
1. **Agent Definition**: Define agents based on their roles in the game (e.g., NPC news anchor, weather reporter).
2. **Contextual Information**: Use game-specific data as context variables.
3. **Tool Integration**: Develop tools that allow NPCs to perform specific actions within the game world.

## Detailed Implementation

Below is a detailed implementation guide adapting the notebook code for Luanti Voyager.

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
```python
!pip install -qU git+https://github.com/openai/swarm.git
```

### Step 2: Set Up API Key
```python
import os
import getpass

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("OpenAI API Key:")
```

### Step 3: Initialize Swarm Client
```python
from swarm import Swarm

swarm_client = Swarm()
```

### Step 4: Define Main NPC Instructions
```python
def main_npc_instructions(context_variables):
    local_context = context_variables["local_context"]
    todays_date = context_variables["todays_date"]
    return f"""You must act like a local news anchor named 'Peter Jennings' - and talk about the local events in {local_context}. You do not mark the routine in your generated text.
    1. You must talk about events that occured on or before {todays_date}.
    2. When you are done talking about local events, you must call the pass_to_weather_anchor function."""
```

### Step 5: Create Main NPC Agent
```python
from swarm import Agent

main_npc_agent = Agent(
    name="Main NPC",
    instructions=main_npc_instructions,
)
```

### Step 6: Define Weather Tool and Instructions for Weather NPC
```python
def weather_tool(region: str):
    """Call this tool when you need to learn about the weather in a specific region."""
    return f"The weather in {region} is 18 degrees C, light winds, clear."

weather_npc_agent = Agent(
    name="Weather NPC",
    instructions="""You are a goofy and fun-loving Weather NPC.
    You follow the following routine:
    1. Look up the local weather using the weather_tool, and then talk about the weather and pass back to the Main NPC.
    You MUST call the pass_to_main_npc function when you are done.""",
    functions=[weather_tool]
)
```

### Step 7: Set Up Context Variables
```python
local_context = {
    "local_context": "Ingame Village",
    "todays_date": "July 1st, 2023"
}
```

### Step 8: Run the Swarm with Initial Message
```python
response = swarm_client.run(
    agent=main_npc_agent,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Begin the newscast!"}],
    context_variables=local_context,
    debug=True
)

print(response.messages[-1]["content"])
```

## Game-Specific Adaptations

To adapt this system to a Minecraft-like environment, specific modifications are necessary:
1. **Game Context**: Use game-specific locations and events.
2. **Agent Roles**: Define roles that fit the game mechanics (e.g., village elder, blacksmith, farmer).
3. **Tools**: Develop tools relevant to the game world (e.g., crop growth status, ore availability).

## Integration Points

### Game Architecture Fit:
1. **World Generation**: Agents can be integrated during world generation to populate NPCs.
2. **Event Handling**: Agents should respond to in-game events like resource scarcity or player achievements.
3. **Player Interaction**: Agents should interact with players through dialogues and tasks.

## Performance Considerations

1. **Agent Load Balancing**: Ensure that the number of agents does not overload the game server.
2. **Caching**: Cache results from tools to avoid redundant API calls.
3. **Asynchronous Processing**: Use asynchronous calls for tool execution to prevent blocking operations.

## Testing Strategy

### Validation in Game Environment:
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual agent behaviors and tools in isolation.
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between agents within the game world.
3. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Conduct user testing to gather feedback on NPC behaviors.

## Example Use Cases

1. **Village News Anchor**:
    - **Scenario**: The village elder announces important events such as festivals or construction projects.
2. **Weather Announcer**:
    - **Scenario**: A weather NPC reports the current weather conditions and advises players accordingly.
3. **Resource Guide**:
    - **Scenario**: A blacksmith NPC provides tips on crafting and resource management.
4. **Event Coordinator**:
    - **Scenario**: An NPC schedules and announces various in-game events like PvP tournaments or treasure hunts.

By following this implementation guide, developers can successfully integrate a Multi-Agent Swarm system into Luanti Voyager, enhancing the game's AI capabilities and creating a more engaging player experience.
